Try running the following chunk and simply take note of the error message – this is one you’ll get a lot!\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n── Attaching core tidyverse packages ──────────────────────── tidyverse 2.0.0 ──\n✔ dplyr     1.1.4     ✔ readr     2.1.5\n✔ forcats   1.0.0     ✔ stringr   1.5.1\n✔ ggplot2   3.5.1     ✔ tibble    3.2.1\n✔ lubridate 1.9.4     ✔ tidyr     1.3.1\n✔ purrr     1.0.2     \n── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──\n✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()\n✖ dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()\nℹ Use the conflicted package (&lt;http://conflicted.r-lib.org/&gt;) to force all conflicts to become errors\n\n# Use the ggplot function\nggplot(hikes, aes(x = rating))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn order to use ggplot tools, we have to first load the tidyverse package in which they live. We’ve installed the package but we need to tell R when we want to use it. Run the chunk below to load the library. You’ll need to do this within any .qmd file that uses ggplot().\n\n# Load the package\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\nExercise 3: Bar Chart of Ratings - Part 1\nConsider some specific research questions about the difficulty rating of the hikes:\n\nHow many hikes fall into each category?\nAre the hikes evenly distributed among these categories, or are some more common than others?\n\nAll of these questions can be answered with: (1) a bar chart; of (2) the categorical data recorded in the rating column. First, set up the plotting frame:\n\nggplot(hikes, aes(x = rating))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThink about:\n\nWhat did this do? What do you observe?\nWhat, in general, is the first argument of the ggplot() function?\nWhat is the purpose of writing x = rating?\nWhat do you think aes stands for?!?\nExercise 4: Bar Chart of Ratings - Part 2\nNow let’s add a geometric layer to the frame / canvas, and start customizing the plot’s theme. To this end, try each chunk below, one by one. In each chunk, make a comment about how both the code and the corresponding plot both changed.\nNOTE:\n\nPay attention to the general code properties and structure, not memorization.\nNot all of these are “good” plots. We’re just exploring ggplot.\n\n\n# The geom_bar() function adds a geometric layer that defaults to the count of each variable, which renders as solid vertical bar, that is, ascending the y axis\nggplot(hikes, aes(x = rating)) +\n  geom_bar()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# The labs function adds custom labels to the x and y axes\nggplot(hikes, aes(x = rating)) +\n  geom_bar() +\n  labs(x = \"Rating\", y = \"Number of hikes\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# The fill argument of the geom_bar function changes the fill, that is, internal, color of the geometry rendered\nggplot(hikes, aes(x = rating)) +\n  geom_bar(fill = \"blue\") +\n  labs(x = \"Rating\", y = \"Number of hikes\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# The color argument of the geom_bar function changes the color of the outline of the geometry rendered\nggplot(hikes, aes(x = rating)) +\n  geom_bar(color = \"orange\", fill = \"blue\") +\n  labs(x = \"Rating\", y = \"Number of hikes\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# The theme_minimal function changes the theme of the rendered plot to a more minimalistic style\nggplot(hikes, aes(x = rating)) +\n  geom_bar(color = \"orange\", fill = \"blue\")  +\n  labs(x = \"Rating\", y = \"Number of hikes\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 5: Bar Chart Follow-up\nPart a\nReflect on the ggplot() code.\n\nWhat’s the purpose of the +? When do we use it? To modify our plot with extra functions (which honestly work more like you’d expect arguments to, but regardless)\nWe added the bars using geom_bar()? Why “geom”? It refers to the bars being geometry, that is, geometric shapes\nWhat does labs() stand for? Labels!\nWhat’s the difference between color and fill? Color refers to outline, fill is the inside!\nPart b\nIn general, bar charts allow us to examine the following properties of a categorical variable:\n\n\nobserved categories: What categories did we observe? Easy, moderate, and difficult\n\nvariability between categories: Are observations evenly spread out among the categories, or are some categories more common than others?\n\nWe must then translate this information into the context of our analysis, here hikes in the Adirondacks. Summarize below what you learned from the bar chart, in context. According to the recorded data, the majority of Adirondacks hikes are moderately difficult. There are less easy hikes, and even less truly difficult ones\nPart c\nIs there anything you don’t like about this barplot? For example: check out the x-axis again.\nExercise 6: Sad Bar Chart\nLet’s now consider some research questions related to the quantitative elevation variable:\n\nAmong the hikes, what’s the range of elevation and how are the hikes distributed within this range (e.g. evenly, in clumps, “normally”)?\nWhat’s a typical elevation?\nAre there any outliers, i.e. hikes that have unusually high or low elevations?\n\nHere:\n\nConstruct a bar chart of the quantitative elevation variable.\n\n\n#\nggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +\n  geom_bar(color = \"orange\", fill = \"blue\")  +\n  labs(x = \"Elevation\", y = \"Number of hikes\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExplain why this might not be an effective visualization for this and other quantitative variables. (What questions does / doesn’t it help answer?) Because it a lot of different individual points but is bad at show any trends because similar points are not properly grouped\nExercise 7: A Histogram of Elevation\nQuantitative variables require different viz than categorical variables. Especially when there are many possible outcomes of the quantitative variable. It’s typically insufficient to simply count up the number of times we’ve observed a particular outcome as the bar graph did above. It gives us a sense of ranges and typical outcomes, but not a good sense of how the observations are distributed across this range. We’ll explore two methods for graphing quantitative variables: histograms and density plots.\nHistograms are constructed by (1) dividing up the observed range of the variable into ‘bins’ of equal width; and (2) counting up the number of cases that fall into each bin. Check out the example below:\n\nPart a\nLet’s dig into some details.\n\nHow many hikes have an elevation between 4500 and 4700 feet? 6\nHow many total hikes have an elevation of at least 5100 feet? 2\nPart b\nNow the bigger picture. In general, histograms allow us to examine the following properties of a quantitative variable:\n\n\ntypical outcome: Where’s the center of the data points? What’s typical?\n\nvariability & range: How spread out are the outcomes? What are the max and min outcomes?\n\nshape: How are values distributed along the observed range? Is the distribution symmetric, right-skewed, left-skewed, bi-modal, or uniform (flat)?\n\noutliers: Are there any outliers, i.e. outcomes that are unusually large/small?\n\nWe must then translate this information into the context of our analysis, here hikes in the Adirondacks. Addressing each of the features in the above list, summarize below what you learned from the histogram, in context.\nExercise 8: Building Histograms - Part 1\n2-MINUTE CHALLENGE: Thinking of the bar chart code, try to intuit what line you can tack on to the below frame of elevation to add a histogram layer. Don’t forget a +. If it doesn’t come to you within 2 minutes, no problem – all will be revealed in the next exercise.\n\nggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 9: Building Histograms - Part 2\nLet’s build some histograms. Try each chunk below, one by one.

Pick better value with `binwidth`.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# THe binwidth argument defines the width of histogram bars, or \"bins\", in this case to 1000 wide, which shows only very vague trends in this data\nggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +\n  geom_histogram(color = \"white\", binwidth = 1000) +\n  labs(x = \"Elevation (feet)\", y = \"Number of hikes\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# here, binwidth is set to 5, which resembles a bar chart fairly closely\nggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +\n  geom_histogram(color = \"white\", binwidth = 5) +\n  labs(x = \"Elevation (feet)\", y = \"Number of hikes\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# when binwidth is set to 200 in this data, trends are fairly reasonably shown, but outliers are sorted in \nggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +\n  geom_histogram(color = \"white\", binwidth = 200) +\n  labs(x = \"Elevation (feet)\", y = \"Number of hikes\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 10: Histogram Follow-up\n\nWhat function added the histogram layer / geometry? geom_histogram\nWhat’s the difference between color and fill? outline color and bin/bar fill color\nWhy does adding color = \"white\" improve the visualization? it creates distinct boundaries between bins\nWhat did binwidth do? sets the x size of a bar/bin on the histogram\nWhy does the histogram become ineffective if the binwidth is too big (e.g. 1000 feet)? trends are vague, the data is averaged\nWhy does the histogram become ineffective if the binwidth is too small (e.g. 5 feet)? the data is a mess; you can’t see trends\nExercise 11: Density Plots\nDensity plots are essentially smooth versions of the histogram. Instead of sorting observations into discrete bins, the “density” of observations is calculated across the entire range of outcomes. The greater the number of observations, the greater the density! The density is then scaled so that the area under the density curve always equals 1 and the area under any fraction of the curve represents the fraction of cases that lie in that range.\nCheck out a density plot of elevation. Notice that the y-axis (density) has no contextual interpretation – it’s a relative measure. The higher the density, the more common are elevations in that range.\n\nggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +\n  geom_density()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestions\n\n\nINTUITION CHECK: Before tweaking the code and thinking back to geom_bar() and geom_histogram(), how do you anticipate the following code will change the plot?\n\n\ngeom_density(color = \"blue\") color of line/curve?\n\ngeom_density(fill = \"orange\") color of area under the curve?\n\n\nTRY IT! Test out those lines in the chunk below. Was your intuition correct?\n\n\nggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +\n  geom_density(color = \"blue\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +\n  geom_density(fill = \"blue\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#History will vindicate Merce Lutzker\n\n\nExamine the density plot. How does it compare to the histogram? What does it tell you about the typical elevation, variability / range in elevations, and shape of the distribution of elevations within this range?\nExercise 12: Density Plots vs Histograms\nThe histogram and density plot both allow us to visualize the behavior of a quantitative variable: typical outcome, variability / range, shape, and outliers. What are the pros/cons of each? What do you like/not like about each? Density plot is better for showing proportions, but it is less clear\nExercise 13: Code = communication\nWe obviously won’t be done until we talk about communication. All code above has a similar general structure (where the details can change):\n\nggplot(___, aes(x = ___)) + \n  geom___(color = \"___\", fill = \"___\") + \n  labs(x = \"___\", y = \"___\")\n\n\nThough not necessary to the code working, it’s common, good practice to indent or tab the lines of code after the first line (counterexample below). Why?\n\n\n# YUCK\nggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +\ngeom_histogram(color = \"white\", binwidth = 200) +\nlabs(x = \"Elevation (feet)\", y = \"Number of hikes\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThough not necessary to the code working, it’s common, good practice to put a line break after each + (counterexample below). Why? readability!\n\n\n# YUCK \nggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) + geom_histogram(color = \"white\", binwidth = 200) + labs(x = \"Elevation (feet)\", y = \"Number of hikes\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 14: Practice\nPart a\nPractice your viz skills to learn about some of the variables in one of the following datasets from the previous class:\n\n# Data on students in this class\nsurvey &lt;- read.csv(\"https://hash-mac.github.io/stat112site-s25/data/survey.csv\")\n\n# World Cup data\nworld_cup &lt;- read.csv(\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2022/2022-11-29/worldcups.csv\")\n\nPart b\nCheck out the RStudio Data Visualization cheat sheet to learn more features of ggplot.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck → Commit → Push\n\n\n\nWhen done, don’t forgot to click Render Book and check the resulting HTML files.

    "text": "8.2 New stuff\nThus far, we’ve been studying one variable at a time, using univariate plots. But once we get a sense of how individual variables behave on their own, our questions often turn to relationships among variables. For example, in our hikes data:\n\nHow much time does it take to complete a hike? ——&gt; How is time related to a hike’s elevation? What about its length?\nHow does difficult rating vary from hike to hike? ——-&gt; How is difficulty rating related to a hike’s ascent?\n\n\n8.2.1 Exploring relationships\nExploring univariate patterns often sparks follow-up questions about relationships between 2+ variables. Often, but not always, variables take on specific roles:\n\n\nresponse variable: the variable whose variability we would like to explain (time to complete a hike)\n\npredictors: variables that might explain some of the variability in the response (a hike’s elevation or length)\n\nVisualizations can help explore:\n\nrelationship trends (direction and form)\nrelationship strength (degree of variability from the trend)\n\noutliers in the relationship\n\nExample 3\nFor each pair of variables below, sketch on paper a visualization of their relationship. Focus on general viz process, don’t worry about the exact details. The data here are totally made up.\n\n3pm temperature (response) vs 9am temperature (predictor)\n\n\ndata.frame(temp_3pm = c(24, 26, 20, 15, 15, 15), temp_9am = c(14, 18, 15, 13, 11, 11))\n\n  temp_3pm temp_9am\n1       24       14\n2       26       18\n3       20       15\n4       15       13\n5       15       11\n6       15       11\n\n\n\n3pm temperature (response) vs location (predictor)\n\n\nweather &lt;- data.frame(temp_3pm = c(24, 26, 20, 15, 15, 0, 40, 60, 57, 44, 51, 75),\n                      location = rep(c(\"A\", \"B\"), each = 6))\nweather\n\n   temp_3pm location\n1        24        A\n2        26        A\n3        20        A\n4        15        A\n5        15        A\n6         0        A\n7        40        B\n8        60        B\n9        57        B\n10       44        B\n11       51        B\n12       75        B\n\n\nThink: How might we modify the below density plot of temp_3pm to distinguish between locations?

In general:\n\nEach quantitative variable requires a new axis (or a quantitative scale if we run out of axes).\nEach categorical variable requires a new way to “group” the graphic (eg: using colors, shapes, separate facets, etc)\nFor visualizations in which overlap in glyphs or plots obscures the patterns, try faceting or transparency.",

Porbably like 68%? maybe like in the low-mid 70s\nThen make a plot of the winner variable.\nThen discuss what follow-up questions you might have (and that our data might help us answer). Woah there! I forgot about populations.\n\n\nggplot(elections, aes(x=winner_20)) +\ngeom_bar(fill=\"purple\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPart b\nThe repub_pct_20 variable provides more detail about the Republican support in each county. Construct a plot of repub_pct_20.\nNotice that the distribution of Republican support from county to county is slightly left skewed or negatively skewed.\nWhat follow-up questions do you have? What’s the average size of those counties?\n\nggplot(elections, aes(x=repub_pct_20)) +\ngeom_histogram(fill=\"magenta\",color=\"coral\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 1: Quantitative vs Quantitative Intuition Check\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBe Quick\n\n\n\nDon’t spend more than 3 minutes on this!\n\n\nBelow is a scatterplot of the Republican support in 2020 vs 2016. Notice that:\n\nboth variables are quantitative, and get their own axes\nthe response variable is on the y-axis, demonstrating how repub_pct_20 might be predicted by repub_pct_16, not vice versa\n\nTry to replicate this using ggplot(). THINK:\n\nWhat info do you need to set up the canvas?\nWhat geometric layer (geom_???) might add these dots / points for each county? We haven’t learned this yet, just take some guesses.\n\n\n\nggplot(elections, aes(x=repub_pct_16,y=repub_pct_20)) +\n  geom_point()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 2: 2 Quantitiative Variables\nRun each chunk below to build up a a scatterplot of repub_pct_20 vs repub_pct_16 with different glyphs representing each county. Address or think about any prompts in the comments (#).\n\n# Set up the plotting frame\n# How does this differ than the frame for our histogram of repub_pct_20 alone?\nggplot(elections, aes(y = repub_pct_20, x = repub_pct_16))\n\n\n# Add a layer of points for each county\n# Take note of the geom!\nggplot(elections, aes(y = repub_pct_20, x = repub_pct_16)) +\n  geom_point()\n\n\n# Change the shape of the points\n# What happens if you change the shape to another number?\nggplot(elections, aes(y = repub_pct_20, x = repub_pct_16)) +\n  geom_point(shape =20)\n\n\n# YOU TRY: Modify the code to make the points \"orange\"\n# NOTE: Try to anticipate if \"color\" or \"fill\" will be useful here. Then try both.\nggplot(elections, aes(y = repub_pct_20, x = repub_pct_16)) +\n  geom_point(color=\"orange\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#color seems cuz there are hollow shapes and also they seem vectory\n\n\n# Add a layer that represents each county by the state it's in\n# Take note of the geom and the info it needs to run!\nstr(elections)\nggplot(elections, aes(y = repub_pct_20, x = repub_pct_16)) +\n  geom_text(aes(label = state_abbr))\n\nExercise 3: Reflect\nSummarize the relationship between the Republican support in 2020 and 2016. Be sure to comment on: - the strength of the relationship (weak/moderate/strong)\n- the direction of the relationship (positive/negative)\n- outliers (in what state do counties deviate from the national trend? Any ideas why this might be the case?)\nRepublican support in 2016 had a somewhat strong positive relationship with republican support in 2020, although there was a significant number of outliers, almost all of any size with republican deviations, particularly in Texas and Utah, and especially Texan counties that leaned blue in 2016. This could possibly relate to either the refugee crisis that emerged on the southern border in this period among other possible factors ### Exercise 4: Visualizing trend {.unnumbered}\nThe trend of the relationship between repub_pct_20 and repub_pct_16 is clearly positive and (mostly) linear. We can highlight this trend by adding a model “smooth” to the plot:\n\nggplot(elections, aes(y = repub_pct_20, x = repub_pct_16)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth()\n\nPart a\nConstruct a new plot that contains the model smooth but does not include the individual point glyphs.\n\nggplot(elections, aes(y = repub_pct_20, x = repub_pct_16)) +\n  geom_smooth()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPart b\nBy default, geom_smooth() adds a smooth, localized model line. To examine the “best” linear model, we can specify method = \"lm\". It’s pretty similar in this example!\n\nggplot(elections, aes(y = repub_pct_20, x = repub_pct_16)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\")\n\nExercise 5: Your Turn\nTo examine how the 2020 results are related to some county demographics, construct scatterplots of repub_pct_20 vs median_rent, and repub_pct_20 vs median_age. Summarize the relationship between these two variables and comment on which is the better predictor of repub_pct_20, median_rent or median_age. Low median rents median rents are a better predictor of how red a county voted in 2020 than median age. low median rent counties are somewhat densly clustered around around in a range between 83 and 63% republican support. while some correlation exists between median age and republican support in 2020, the range with the most counties, around 40, is fairly scattered, and a mean line is fairly flat in comparison with rent\n\n# Scatterplot of repub_pct_20 vs median_rent\nggplot(elections, aes(y = repub_pct_20, x = median_rent)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Scatterplot of repub_pct_20 vs median_age\nggplot(elections, aes(y = repub_pct_20, x = median_age)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 6: A Sad Scatterplot\nNext, let’s explore the relationship between a county’s 2020 Republican support repub_pct_20 and the historical political trends in its state. In this case repub_pct_20 is quantitative, but historical is categorical. Explain why a scatterplot might not be an effective visualization for exploring this relationship. (What questions does / doesn’t it help answer?) because there are only three values for the categorical variables, individual points will be tightly clustered and it will be hard to see densities or numbers of counties within each category\n\nggplot(elections, aes(y = repub_pct_20, x = historical)) +\n  geom_point()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 7: Quantitative vs Categorical – Violins & Boxes\nThough the above scatterplot did group the counties by historical category, it’s nearly impossible to pick out meaningful patterns in 2020 Republican support in each category. Let’s try adding 2 different geom layers to the frame:\n\n# Side-by-side violin plots\nggplot(elections, aes(y = repub_pct_20, x = historical)) +\n  geom_violin()\n\n\n# Side-by-side boxplots (defined below)\nggplot(elections, aes(y = repub_pct_20, x = historical)) +\n  geom_boxplot()\n\nBox plots are constructed from five numbers - the minimum, 25th percentile, median, 75th percentile, and maximum value of a quantitative variable:\n\nREFLECT:\nSummarize what you’ve learned about the 2020 Republican county-level support within and between red/purple/blue states. It seems that while the median in blue, purple, and red counties all was above 50% republic, there was a very long dem skew tail, including a very large number out outliers, particularly in historically red counties. This skew tail was fairly dense in blue counties, as well\nExercise 8: Quantitative vs Categorical – Intuition Check\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBe Quick\n\n\n\nDon’t spend more than 3 minutes on this!\n\n\nWe can also visualize the relationship between repub_pct_20 and historical using our familiar density plots. In the plot below, notice that we simply created a separate density plot for each historical category. (The plot itself is “bad” but we’ll fix it below.) Try to adjust the code chunk below, which starts with a density plot of repub_pct_20 alone, to re-create this image.\n\n\nggplot(elections, aes(x = repub_pct_20)) +\n  geom_density(aes(fill=\"historical\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#nope, lol\n\nExercise 9: Quantitative vs Categorical – Density Plots\nWork through the chunks below and address the comments therein.\n\n# Name two \"bad\" things about this plot\nggplot(elections, aes(x = repub_pct_20, fill = historical)) +\n  geom_density()\n#I was so close! anyways, first, the peaks of the graph are covered by eachother, and secondly the colors of the fill do not match the titles of the variables, which is confusing because they are named after colors\n\n\n# What does scale_fill_manual do?\nggplot(elections, aes(x = repub_pct_20, fill = historical)) +\n  geom_density() +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"blue\", \"purple\", \"red\"))\n#scale_fill_manual allows you to specify the colors in a fill of this sort\n\n\n# What does alpha = 0.5 do?\n# Play around with different values of alpha, between 0 and 1\nggplot(elections, aes(x = repub_pct_20, fill = historical)) +\n  geom_density(alpha = 0.3) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"blue\", \"purple\", \"red\"))\n#alpha changes the transparency of each fill\n\n\n# What does facet_wrap do?!\nggplot(elections, aes(x = repub_pct_20, fill = historical)) +\n  geom_density() +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"blue\", \"purple\", \"red\")) +\n  facet_wrap(~ historical)\n#woah! facet_wrap is able to add another dimension of data it looks like by splitting our viz into several side-by-side graphs\n\n\n# Let's try a similar grouping strategy with a histogram instead of density plot.\n# Why is this terrible?\nggplot(elections, aes(x = repub_pct_20, fill = historical)) +\n  geom_histogram(color = \"white\") +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"blue\", \"purple\", \"red\"))\n#this sucks because not only does it overlap, but because it goes by count instead of density,  its harder to judge trends between the three categories, because of the different numbers of each. in fact, its not neccesarily clear how each bar is overlapping the other at all. each bin also implies that they are making up one part of a something connected, rather than just have the same voting habits in 2020\n\nExercise 10\nWe’ve now learned 3 (of many) ways to visualize the relationship between a quantitative and categorical variable: side-by-side violins, boxplots, and density plots.\n\nWhich do you like best?\nWhat is one pro of density plots relative to boxplots?\nWhat is one con of density plots relative to boxplots? I think I prefer density plots because they are easier to read at a glance and provide granular knowledge about densities, although boxplots note outliers in a very helpful way, and do some of the analysis for you (like finding medians and percentiles).\nExercise 11: Categorical vs Categorical – Intuition Check\nFinally, let’s simply explore who won each county in 2020 (winner_20) and how this breaks down by historical voting trends in the state. That is, let’s explore the relationship between 2 categorical variables! Following the same themes as above, we can utilize grouping features such as fill/color or facets to distinguish between different categories of winner_20 and historical.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBe Quick\n\n\n\nSpend at most 5 minutes on the following intuition check. Adjust the code below to recreate the following two plots.\n\n\n\n\n# Plot 1: adjust this to recreate the top plot\nggplot(elections, aes(x = historical, fill = winner_20)) +\n  geom_bar() +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"salmon\",\"turquoise3\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#i think i got the color too lol. weird to me that theres no teal\n\n\n# Plot 2: adjust this to recreate the bottom plot\nggplot(elections, aes(x = winner_20)) +\n  geom_bar() +\n  facet_wrap(~ historical)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 12: Categorical vs Categorical\nConstruct the following 4 bar plot visualizations.\n\n# A stacked bar plot\n# How are the \"historical\" and \"winner_20\" variables mapped to the plot, i.e. what roles do they play?\nggplot(elections, aes(x = historical, fill = winner_20)) +\n  geom_bar()\n#oh lol the color was automatic\n\n\n# A faceted bar plot\nggplot(elections, aes(x = winner_20)) +\n  geom_bar() +\n  facet_wrap(~ historical)\n\n\n# A side-by-side bar plot\n# Note the new argument to geom_bar\nggplot(elections, aes(x = historical, fill = winner_20)) +\n  geom_bar(position = \"dodge\")\n\n\n# A proportional bar plot\n# Note the new argument to geom_bar\nggplot(elections, aes(x = historical, fill = winner_20)) +\n  geom_bar(position = \"fill\")\n\nPart a\nName one pro and one con of using the “proportional bar plot” instead of one of the other three options.\nThe way it fills the space makes the ratio much easier to discern, although of course we aren’t able to see granular quantities\nPart b\nWhat’s your favorite bar plot from part and why? I like both the side-by-side and the faceted: they’re handsome and easy to read and compare, and while the faceted is more quirky, the side-by-side is probably more readerly\nExercise 13: Practice (now or later)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecide\n\n\n\nDecide what’s best for you:\n\nTry this extra practice now.\nReflect on the above exercises and come back to this extra practice later (but before the next class).\n\n\n\nImport some daily weather data from a few locations in Australia:\n\nweather &lt;- read.csv(\"https://mac-stat.github.io/data/weather_3_locations.csv\")\nstr(weather)\n\n'data.frame':   2367 obs. of  24 variables:\n $ date         : chr  \"2020-01-01\" \"2020-01-02\" \"2020-01-03\" \"2020-01-04\" ...\n $ location     : chr  \"Wollongong\" \"Wollongong\" \"Wollongong\" \"Wollongong\" ...\n $ mintemp      : num  17.1 17.7 19.7 20.4 19.8 18.3 19.9 20.1 19.8 20.5 ...\n $ maxtemp      : num  23.1 24.2 26.8 35.5 21.4 22.9 25.6 23.2 23.1 25.4 ...\n $ rainfall     : num  0 0 0 0 0 0 0.8 1.6 0 0 ...\n $ evaporation  : num  NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA ...\n $ sunshine     : num  NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA ...\n $ windgustdir  : chr  \"SSW\" \"SSW\" \"NE\" \"SSW\" ...\n $ windgustspeed: int  39 37 41 78 57 35 44 41 39 56 ...\n $ winddir9am   : chr  \"SSW\" \"S\" \"NNW\" \"NE\" ...\n $ winddir3pm   : chr  \"SSE\" \"ENE\" \"NNE\" \"NNE\" ...\n $ windspeed9am : int  20 13 7 15 31 17 30 31 24 19 ...\n $ windspeed3pm : int  15 15 17 17 35 20 7 33 26 39 ...\n $ humidity9am  : int  69 72 72 77 70 71 76 77 76 79 ...\n $ humidity3pm  : int  64 54 71 69 75 71 72 76 79 76 ...\n $ pressure9am  : num  1015 1020 1018 1009 1019 ...\n $ pressure3pm  : num  1014 1018 1013 1004 1020 ...\n $ cloud9am     : int  8 7 6 NA NA NA NA 8 NA NA ...\n $ cloud3pm     : int  1 1 NA NA 7 NA NA NA NA NA ...\n $ temp9am      : num  19.1 19.8 23.4 24.5 20.7 20.9 22.9 21.3 21.2 23 ...\n $ temp3pm      : num  22.9 23.6 25.7 26.7 20 22.6 24.9 22.2 22.2 25.1 ...\n $ raintoday    : chr  \"No\" \"No\" \"No\" \"No\" ...\n $ risk_mm      : num  0 0 0 0 0 0.8 1.6 0 0 1 ...\n $ raintomorrow : chr  \"No\" \"No\" \"No\" \"No\" ...\n\n\nConstruct plots that address the research questions in each chunk. You might make multiple plots–there are many ways to do things!. However, don’t just throw spaghetti at the wall.\nReflect before doing anything. What types of variables are these? How might you plot just 1 of the variables, and then tweak the plot to incorporate the other?\n\n# How do 3pm temperatures (temp3pm) differ by location?\n#I have to compare many entries between a categorical variable with three values and a quantitative variable.

But they’re not the only way to visualize the variables in our dataset.\nOptional Exercise 1: Many Categories\nSuppose we wanted to better understand how the 2020 Republican support varied from county to county within each state.

To make a ridgeline plot, we can use the geom_density_ridges() function from the ggridges package.\n\n# Install ggridges package\nlibrary(ggridges)\n\n# Make our first joy plot\n# THINK: What DON'T you like about this?\nggplot(elections, aes(x = repub_pct_20, y = state_abbr)) + \n  geom_density_ridges()\n\n\n# Let's put the states in order by Republican support, not alphabet\n# How do you think fct_reorder works?

The least?\nWhat other interesting patterns do you notice?\nDoes this plot prompt any other questions?\nOptional Exercise 2: Total Outcomes by State\nLet’s import some new data and counts up the total votes (Republican and Democratic) by state, not county. This was wrangled from the elections data!\n\nelections_by_state &lt;- read.csv(\"https://mac-stat.github.io/data/election_2020_by_state.csv\")\n\nFor example, we might make a scatterplot of the 2020 vs 2016 outcomes:\n\nggplot(elections_by_state, aes(y = repub_pct_20, x = repub_pct_16)) + \n  geom_point()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBUT this isn’t the easiest way to communicate or identify the changes from 1 year to the next.\n\n# YOU TRY\n# Start by creating a \"scatterplot\" of state_abbr (y-axis) by 2020 Republican support on the x-axis\n# Color the points red\n# Scroll to solutions below when you're ready\n\n\n# Check it out\nggplot(elections_by_state, aes(x = repub_pct_20, y = state_abbr)) + \n  geom_point(color = \"red\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# YOU TRY\n# Reorder the states in terms of their 2020 Republican support (not alphabet)\n# Scroll to solutions below when you're ready\n\n\n# Check it out\nggplot(elections_by_state, aes(x = repub_pct_20, y = fct_reorder(state_abbr, repub_pct_20))) + \n  geom_point(color = \"red\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Finally, add ANOTHER layer of points for the 2016 outcomes\n# What info does this new geom_point() layer need to run?\nggplot(elections_by_state, aes(x = repub_pct_20, y = fct_reorder(state_abbr, repub_pct_20))) + \n  geom_point(color = \"red\") + \n  geom_point(aes(x = repub_pct_16, y = state_abbr))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReflect on the following\n\nWhat do you think this plot needs? Try it! You might need to do some digging online.\nSummarize the main takeaways from the plots. Which states changed the most from 2016 to 2020? The least? Where did the Republican support increase? Where did it decrease?\nWhat other questions are you left with?",

There, they range from ~5 to ~45 with a typical temp around ~15 degrees.\nWollongong temps are in between and are the least variable from day to day.\n\nSUBTLETIES: Defining fill or color by a variable\nHow we define the fill or color depends upon whether we’re defining it by a named color or by some variable in our dataset. For example:\n\ngeom___(fill = \"blue\")named colors are defined outside the aesthetics and put in quotes\ngeom___(aes(fill = variable)) or ggplot(___, aes(fill = variable))\ncolors/fills defined by a variable are defined inside the aesthetics\nExample 3\nLet’s consider Wollongong alone:\n\n# Don't worry about the syntax (we'll learn it soon)\nwoll &lt;- weather |&gt;\n  filter(location == \"Wollongong\") |&gt; \n  mutate(date = as.Date(date))  \n\n\n# How often does it raintoday?\n# Fill your geometric layer with the color blue.\nggplot(woll, aes(x = raintoday)) +\n  geom_bar(fill=\"blue\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# If it does raintoday, what does this tell us about raintomorrow?\n# Use your intuition first\nggplot(woll, aes(x = raintoday, fill=raintomorrow)) +\n  geom_bar(position = \"dodge\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Now compare different approaches\n\n# Default: stacked bars\nggplot(woll, aes(x = raintoday, fill = raintomorrow)) + \n  geom_bar()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Side-by-side bars\nggplot(woll, aes(x = raintoday, fill = raintomorrow)) + \n  geom_bar(position = \"dodge\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Proportional bars\n# position = \"fill\" refers to filling the frame, nothing to do with the color-related fill\nggplot(woll, aes(x = raintoday, fill = raintomorrow)) + \n  geom_bar(position = \"fill\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReflection\nThere’s often not one “best plot”, but a combination of plots that provide a complete picture:\n\nThe stacked and side-by-side bars reflect that on most days, it does not rain.\nThe proportional / filled bars lose that information, but make it easier to compare proportions: it’s more likely to rain tomorrow if it also rains today.\nExample 4\nConstruct a plot that illustrates how 3pm temperatures (temp3pm) vary by date in Wollongong.

There are also some outliers – some abnormally hot and cold days.",

    "text": "9.2 New Stuff\nNext, let’s consider the entire weather data for all 3 locations. The addition of location adds a 3rd variable into our research questions:\n\nHow does the relationship between raintoday and raintomorrow vary by location?\nHow does the behavior of temp3pm over date vary by location?\nAnd so on.\n\nThus far, we’ve focused on the following components of a plot:\n\nsetting up a frame\n\nadding layers / geometric elements\nsplitting the plot into facets for different groups / categories\nchange the theme, e.g. axis labels, color, fill\n\nWe’ll have to think about all of this, along with scales. Scales change the color, fill, size, shape, or other properties according to the levels of a new variable. This is different than just assigning scale by, for example, color = \"blue\".\nWork on the examples below in your groups. Check in with your intuition! We’ll then discuss as a group as relevant.\nExample 5\n\n# Plot temp3pm vs temp9am\n# Change the code in order to indicate the location to which each data point corresponds\nggplot(weather, aes(y = temp3pm, x = temp9am, color=location)) + \n  geom_point(alpha=0.7)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Change the code in order to indicate the location to which each data point corresponds\n# AND identify the days on which it rained / didn't raintoday\nggplot(weather, aes(y = temp3pm, x = temp9am, color=location)) + \n  geom_point(alpha=0.7, aes(shape=raintoday))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# How many ways can you think to make that plot of temp3pm vs temp9am with info about location and rain?\n# Play around!\nggplot(weather, aes(y = temp3pm, x = temp9am, color=location)) + \n  geom_text(alpha=0.7,size=3.5,aes(label=raintoday))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 6\n\n# Change the code in order to construct a line plot of temp3pm vs date for each separate location (no points!)\nggplot(weather, aes(y = temp3pm, x = date, color=location)) + \n  geom_line()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 7\n\n# Plot the relationship of raintomorrow & raintoday\n# Change the code in order to indicate this relationship by location\nggplot(weather, aes(x = raintoday, fill=raintomorrow)) + \n  geom_bar(position = \"fill\") +\n  facet_wrap(~ location) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n#i tried like a million ways. it would probably work better if i changed something like position but i wanted to not disrupt structure. color and alpha are both illegible. honestly, something other than a bar graph might work better. good old facet. nothing beats facet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to Not Get Overwhelmed?\n\n\n\nThere’s no end to the number and type of visualizations you could make. And it’s important to not just throw spaghetti at the wall until something sticks. FlowingData shows that one dataset can be visualized many ways, and makes good recommendations for data viz workflow, which we modify and build upon here:\n\nIdentify simple research questions.\nWhat do you want to understand about the variables or the relationships among them?\n\nStart with the basics and work incrementally.\n\nIdentify what variables you want to include in your plot and what structure these have (eg: categorical, quantitative, dates)\nStart simply. Build a plot of just 1 of these variables, or the relationship between 2 of these variables.\nSet up a plotting frame and add just one geometric layer at a time.\nStart tweaking: add whatever new variables you want to examine,\n\n\n\nAsk your plot questions.\n\nWhat questions does your plot answer? What questions are left unanswered by your plot?\nWhat new questions does your plot spark / inspire?\nDo you have the viz tools to answer these questions, or might you learn more?\n\n\nFocus.\nReporting a large number of visualizations can overwhelm the audience and obscure your conclusions. Instead, pick out a focused yet comprehensive set of visualizations.",

    "text": "9.3 Exercises (required)\nThe story\nThough far from a perfect assessment of academic preparedness, SAT scores have historically been used as one measurement of a state’s education system. The education dataset contains various education variables for each state:\n\n# Import and check out data\neducation &lt;- read.csv(\"https://mac-stat.github.io/data/sat.csv\")\nhead(education)\n\n       State expend ratio salary frac verbal math  sat  fracCat\n1    Alabama  4.405  17.2 31.144    8    491  538 1029   (0,15]\n2     Alaska  8.963  17.6 47.951   47    445  489  934 (45,100]\n3    Arizona  4.778  19.3 32.175   27    448  496  944  (15,45]\n4   Arkansas  4.459  17.1 28.934    6    482  523 1005   (0,15]\n5 California  4.992  24.0 41.078   45    417  485  902  (15,45]\n6   Colorado  5.443  18.4 34.571   29    462  518  980  (15,45]\n\n\nA codebook is provided by Danny Kaplan who also made these data accessible:\n\nExercise 1: SAT scores\nPart a\nConstruct a plot of how the average sat scores vary across states (HINT: you need to use the sat variable only).\n\nggplot(education, aes(x=sat)) +\n  geom_density(color=\"white\",fill=\"skyblue\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPart b\nSummarize your observations from the plot. Comment on the basics: range, typical outcomes, shape. (Any theories about what might explain this non-normal shape?)\nThere are lots of states with average scores in the 900 range, and also a good number in a broader 1030 range, but there are a lot fewer States with average scores in the 960-ish range\nExercise 2: SAT Scores vs Per Pupil Spending & SAT Scores vs Salaries\nThe first question we’d like to answer is: Can the variability in sat scores from state to state be partially explained by how much a state spends on education, specifically its per pupil spending (expend) and typical teacher salary?\nPart a\n\n# Construct a plot of sat vs expend\n# Include a \"best fit linear regression model\" (HINT: method = \"lm\")\nggplot(education, aes(y=sat,x=expend)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(method=\"lm\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Construct a plot of sat vs salary\n# Include a \"best fit linear regression model\" (HINT: method = \"lm\")\nggplot(education, aes(y=sat,x=salary)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(method=\"lm\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPart b\nWhat are the relationship trends between SAT scores and spending? Is there anything that surprises you?\nThere seems to be pretty vague/weak, but somewhat negative relationship between spending, both on salary and per student, and SAT scores\nExercise 3: SAT Scores vs Per Pupil Spending and Teacher Salaries\nConstruct one visualization of the relationship of sat with salary and expend. HINT: Start with just 2 variables and tweak that code to add the third variable. Try out a few things!\n\nggplot(education, aes(y=sat,color=expend,x=salary)) +\n  geom_point(size=1.5) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 4: Another way to Incorporate Scale\nIt can be tough to distinguish color scales and size scales for quantitative variables. Another option is to discretize a quantitative variable, or basically cut it up into categories.\nConstruct the plot below. Check out the code and think about what’s happening here. What happens if you change “2” to “3”?\n\nggplot(education, aes(y = sat, x = salary, color = cut(expend, 5))) + \n  geom_point() + \n  geom_smooth(se = FALSE, method = \"lm\")\n\nDescribe the trivariate relationship between sat, salary, and expend. SAT scores mostly decrease with spending on both salary and per student, but the negative relationship between SAT scores and teacher salary is weaker in states where more is spent per student, becoming actually positive past 8550 dollars spent per student\nExercise 5: Finally an Explanation\nIt’s strange that SAT scores seem to decrease with spending. But we’re leaving out an important variable from our analysis: the fraction of a state’s students that actually take the SAT. The fracCat variable indicates this fraction: low (under 15% take the SAT), medium (15-45% take the SAT), and high (at least 45% take the SAT).\nPart a\nBuild a univariate viz of fracCat to better understand how many states fall into each category.\n\nggplot(education,aes(x=fracCat)) +\n  geom_bar()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPart b\nBuild 2 bivariate visualizations that demonstrate the relationship between sat and fracCat. What story does your graphic tell and why does this make contextual sense?\n\nggplot(education,aes(x=fracCat, y=sat)) +\n  geom_violin(fill=\"turquoise\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPart c\nMake a trivariate visualization that demonstrates the relationship of sat with expend AND fracCat. Highlight the differences in fracCat groups through color AND unique trend lines. What story does your graphic tell? Does it still seem that SAT scores decrease as spending increases?\nNo. Within all groups, SAT scores increase somewhat as spending increases, even if there are large differences in scores between groups of states which administer more or fewer SATs to students\n\nggplot(education, aes(y=sat,x=expend,shape=fracCat)) +\n  geom_point(size=1.5) +\n  geom_smooth(method=\"lm\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPart d\nPutting all of this together, explain this example of Simpson’s Paradox. That is, why did it appear that SAT scores decrease as spending increases even though the opposite is true?\nBecause education spending was linked with a second predictor variable, the number of SATs administered, which has a negative relationship with SAT scores, as SATs are only administered to students who have the money, time, and desire to prepare for them",

    "text": "9.4 Exercises (optional)\nExercise 6: Heat Maps\nAs usual, we’ve only just scratched the surface! There are lots of other data viz techniques for exploring multivariate relationships. Let’s start with a heat map.\nPart a\nRun the chunks below. Check out the code, but don’t worry about every little detail! NOTES:\n\nThis is not part of the ggplot() grammar, making it a bit complicated.\nIf you’re curious about what a line in the plot does, comment it out (#) and check out what happens!\nIn the plot, for each state (row), each variable (column) is scaled to indicate whether the state has a relative high value (yellow), a relatively low value (purple), or something in between (blues/greens).\nYou can also play with the color scheme. Type ?cm.colors in the console to learn about various options.\nWe’ll improve the plot later, so don’t spend too much time trying to learn something from this plot.\n\n\n# Remove the \"State\" column and use it to label the rows\n# Then scale the variables\nplot_data &lt;- education |&gt; \n  column_to_rownames(\"State\") |&gt; \n  data.matrix() |&gt; \n  scale()\n\n# Load the gplots package needed for heatmaps\nlibrary(gplots)\n\n# Construct heatmap 1\nheatmap.2(plot_data,\n  dendrogram = \"none\",\n  Rowv = NA, \n  scale = \"column\",\n  keysize = 0.7, \n  density.info = \"none\",\n  col = hcl.colors(256), \n  margins = c(10, 20),\n  colsep = c(1:7), rowsep = (1:50), sepwidth = c(0.05, 0.05),\n  sepcolor = \"white\", trace = \"none\"\n)\n\n\n# Construct heatmap 2\nheatmap.2(plot_data,\n  dendrogram = \"none\",\n  Rowv = TRUE,             ### WE CHANGED THIS FROM NA TO TRUE\n  scale = \"column\",\n  keysize = 0.7, \n  density.info = \"none\",\n  col = hcl.colors(256), \n  margins = c(10, 20),\n  colsep = c(1:7), rowsep = (1:50), sepwidth = c(0.05, 0.05),\n  sepcolor = \"white\", trace = \"none\"\n)\n\n\n# Construct heatmap 3\nheatmap.2(plot_data,\n  dendrogram = \"row\",       ### WE CHANGED THIS FROM \"none\" TO \"row\"\n  Rowv = TRUE,            \n  scale = \"column\",\n  keysize = 0.7, \n  density.info = \"none\",\n  col = hcl.colors(256), \n  margins = c(10, 20),\n  colsep = c(1:7), rowsep = (1:50), sepwidth = c(0.05, 0.05),\n  sepcolor = \"white\", trace = \"none\"\n)\n\nPart b\nIn the final two plots, the states (rows) are rearranged by similarity with respect to these education metrics. The final plot includes a dendrogram which further indicates clusters of similar states. In short, states that have a shorter path to connection are more similar than others.\nPutting this all together, what insight do you gain about the education trends across U.S. states? Which states are similar? In what ways are they similar? Are there any outliers with respect to 1 or more of the education metrics?\nExercise 7: Star plots\nLike heat maps, star plots indicate the relative scale of each variable for each state. Thus, we can use star maps to identify similar groups of states, and unusual states!\nPart a\nConstruct and check out the star plot below. Note that each state has a “pie”, with each segment corresponding to a different variable. The larger a segment, the larger that variable’s value is in that state. For example:\n\nCheck out Minnesota. How does Minnesota’s education metrics compare to those in other states? What metrics are relatively high? Relatively low?\nWhat states appear to be similar? Do these observations agree with those that you gained from the heat map?\n\n\nstars(plot_data,\n  flip.labels = FALSE,\n  key.loc = c(10, 1.5),\n  cex = 1, \n  draw.segments = TRUE\n)\n\nPart b\nFinally, let’s plot the state stars by geographic location! What new insight do you gain here?!\n\nstars(plot_data,\n  flip.labels = FALSE,\n  locations = data.matrix(as.data.frame(state.center)),  # added external data to arrange by geo location\n  key.loc = c(-110, 28),\n  cex = 1, \n  draw.segments = TRUE\n)",

How does this differ by address? The plot shows that at a, energy use can range anywhere from ~460 to 25 therms, but is usually either in the vicinity of ~380 or of 55 therms, while at b, energy use tops out at just shy of 400 therms, and can approach nearly 0, but is usually around 45 therms.\n\nggplot(energy, aes(y=therms,x=address)) +\n  geom_violin(fill=\"chartreuse\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 2\nHow did energy use (therms) change over time (date) at the two addresses?

In general, there are two important pieces to every map:\nPiece 1: A dataset\nThis dataset must include either:\n\nlocation coordinates for your points of interest (for point maps); or\nvariable outcomes for your regions of interest (for choropleth maps)\n\n\nPiece 2: A background map\nWe need latitude and longitude coordinates to specify the boundaries for your regions of interest (eg: countries, states). This is where it gets really sticky!\n\nCounty-level, state-level, country-level, continent-level info live in multiple places.\nWhere we grab this info can depend upon whether we want to make a point map or a choropleth map. (The background maps can be used somewhat interchangeably, but it requires extra code :/)\nWhere we grab this info can also depend upon the structure of our data and how much data wrangling / cleaning we’re up for. For choropleth maps, the labels of regions in our data must match those in the background map. For example, if our data labels states with their abbreviations (eg: MN) and the background map refers to them as full names in lower case (eg: minnesota), we have to wrangle our data so that it matches the background map.\n\nIn short, the code for spatial viz gets very specialized. The goal of these exercises is to:\n\nplay around and experience the wide variety of spatial viz tools out there\nunderstand the difference between point maps and choropleth maps\nhave fun\n\nYou can skip around as you wish and it’s totally fine if you don’t finish everything. Just come back at some point to play around.\nPart 1: Interactive points on a map with leaflet\n\nLeaflet is an open-source JavaScript library for creating maps. We can use it inside R through the leaflet package.\nThis uses a different plotting framework than ggplot2, but still has a tidyverse feel (which will become more clear as we learn other tidyverse tools!).\nThe general steps are as follows:\n\nCreate a map widget by calling leaflet() and telling it the data to use.\nAdd a base map using addTiles() (the default) or addProviderTiles().\nAdd layers to the map using layer functions (e.g. addMarkers(), addPolygons()).\nPrint the map widget to display it.\nExercise 1: A leaflet with markers / points\nEarlier this semester, I asked for the latitude and longitude of one of your favorite places. I rounded these to the nearest whole number, so that they’re near to but not exactly at those places. Let’s load the data and map it!\n\nfave_places &lt;- read.csv(\"https://hash-mac.github.io/stat112site-s25/data/our_fave_places.csv\")\n\n# Check it out\nhead(fave_places)\n\n\n\n  latitude longitude\n1       59        18\n2       45       -93\n3       33      -117\n4       40       116\n5       40       106\n6       37      -122\n\n\nPart a\nYou can use a “two-finger scroll” to zoom in and out.\n\n# Load the leaflet package\nlibrary(leaflet)\n\n# Just a plotting frame\nleaflet(data = fave_places)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Now what do we have?\nleaflet(data = fave_places) |&gt; \n  addTiles()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Now what do we have?\n# longitude and latitude refer to the variables in our data\nleaflet(data = fave_places) |&gt; \n  addTiles() |&gt; \n  addMarkers(lng = ~longitude, lat = ~latitude)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Since we named them \"longitude\" and \"latitude\", the function\n# automatically recognizes these variables. No need to write them!\nleaflet(data = fave_places) |&gt; \n  addTiles() |&gt; \n  addMarkers()\n\n\n\n\n\nPart b\nPLAY AROUND! This map is interactive. Zoom in on one location. Keep zooming – what level of detail can you get into? How does that detail depend upon where you try to zoom in (thus what are the limitations of this tool)?\nExercise 2: Details\nWe can change all sorts of details in leaflet maps.\n\n# Load package needed to change color\nlibrary(gplots)\n\n# We can add colored circles instead of markers at each location\nleaflet(data = fave_places) |&gt; \n  addTiles() |&gt; \n  addCircles(color = col2hex(\"red\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# We can change the background\n# Mark locations with yellow dots\n# And connect the dots, in their order in the dataset, with green lines\n# (These green lines don't mean anything here, but would if this were somebody's travel path!)\nleaflet(data = fave_places) |&gt;\n  addProviderTiles(\"USGS\") |&gt;\n  addCircles(weight = 10, opacity = 1, color = col2hex(\"yellow\")) |&gt;\n  addPolylines(\n    lng = ~longitude,\n    lat = ~latitude,\n    color = col2hex(\"green\")\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nIn general:\n\naddProviderTiles() changes the base map.\nTo explore all available provider base maps, type providers in the console. (Though some don’t work :/)\n\nUse addMarkers() or addCircles() to mark locations. Type ?addControl into the console to pull up a help file which summarizes the aesthetics of these markers and how you can change them. For example:\n\n\nweight = how thick to make the lines, points, pixels\n\nopacity = transparency (like alpha in ggplot2)\ncolors need to be in “hex” form. We used the col2hex() function from the gplots library to do that\n\n\nExercise 3: Your turn\nThe starbucks data, compiled by Danny Kaplan, contains information about every Starbucks in the world at the time the data were collected, including Latitude and Longitude:\n\n# Import starbucks location data\nstarbucks &lt;- read.csv(\"https://mac-stat.github.io/data/starbucks.csv\")\n\nLet’s focus on only those in Minnesota for now:\n\n# Don't worry about the syntax\nstarbucks_mn &lt;- starbucks |&gt;   \n  filter(Country == \"US\", State.Province == \"MN\")\n\nCreate a leaflet map of the Starbucks locations in Minnesota. Keep it simple – go back to Exercise 1 for an example.\n\nleaflet(data = starbucks_mn) |&gt;\n  addTiles() |&gt;\n  addCircles()\n\n\n\n\n\nPart 2: Static points on a map\nLeaflet is very powerful and fun. But:\n\nIt’s not great when we have lots of points to map – it takes lots of time.\nIt makes good interactive maps, but we often need a static map (eg: we can not print interactive maps!).\n\nLet’s explore how to make point maps with ggplot(), not leaflet().\nExercise 3: A simple scatterplot\nLet’s start with the ggplot() tools we already know. Construct a scatterplot of all starbucks locations, not just those in Minnesota, with:\n\nLatitude and Longitude coordinates (which goes on the y-axis?!)\nMake the points transparent (alpha = 0.2) and smaller (size = 0.2)\n\nIt’s pretty cool that the plots we already know can provide some spatial context. But what don’t you like about this plot? Its very difficult to see what countries they’re in, except when its obvious because of density, like the USA\n\nggplot(starbucks, aes(x=Longitude, y=Latitude)) +\n  geom_point(alpha=0.2,size=0.2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 4: Adding a country-level background\nLet’s add a background map of country-level boundaries.\nPart a\nFirst, we can grab country-level boundaries from the rnaturalearth package.\n\n# Load the package\nlibrary(rnaturalearth)\n\n# Get info about country boundaries across the world\n# in a \"sf\" or simple feature format\nworld_boundaries &lt;- ne_countries(returnclass = \"sf\")\n\nIn your console, type world_boundaries to check out what’s stored there. Don’t print it our in your Rmd – printing it would be really messy there (even just the head()).\nPart b\nRun the chunks below to build up a new map.\n\n# What does this code produce?\n# What geom are we using for the point map?\n#hm, geom sf seems interesting\nggplot(world_boundaries) + \n  geom_sf()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Load package needed to change map theme\nlibrary(mosaic)\n\n# Add a point for each Starbucks\n# NOTE: The Starbucks info is in our starbucks data, not world_boundaries\n# How does this change how we use geom_point?!\n# we have to reference the dataset in the layer\nggplot(world_boundaries) + \n  geom_sf() + \n  geom_point(\n    data = starbucks,\n    aes(x = Longitude, y = Latitude),\n    alpha = 0.3, size = 0.2, color = \"darkgreen\"\n  ) +\n  theme_map()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPart c\nSummarize what you learned about Starbucks from this map.\nStarbucks are most concentrated in The United States, England, Japan, Netherlands, South Korea, and the northeast coast of china\nExercise 5: Zooming in on some countries\nInstead of world_boundaries &lt;- ne_countries(returnclass = 'sf') we could zoom in on…\n\nthe continent of Africa: ne_countries(continent = 'Africa', returnclass = 'sf')\n\na set of countries: ne_countries(country = c('france', 'united kingdom', 'germany'), returnclass = 'sf')\n\nboundaries within a country: ne_states(country = 'united states of america', returnclass = 'sf')\n\n\nOur goal here will be to map the Starbucks locations in Canada, Mexico, and the US.\nPart a\nTo make this map, we again need two pieces of information.\n\nData on Starbucks for only Canada, Mexico, and the US, labeled as “CA”, “MX”, “US” in the starbucks data.\n\n\n# We'll learn this syntax soon! Don't worry about it now.\nstarbucks_cma &lt;- starbucks |&gt; \n  filter(Country %in% c('CA', 'MX', 'US'))\n\n\nA background map of state- and national-level boundaries in Canada, Mexico, and the US. This requires ne_states() in the rnaturalearth package where the countries are labeled ‘canada’, ‘mexico’, ‘united states of america’.\n\n\ncma_boundaries &lt;- ne_states(\n  country = c(\"canada\", \"mexico\", \"united states of america\"),\n  returnclass = \"sf\")\n\nPart b\nMake the map!\n\n# Just the boundaries\nggplot(cma_boundaries) + \n  geom_sf()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Add the points\n# And zoom in\nggplot(cma_boundaries) + \n  geom_sf() + \n  geom_point(\n    data = starbucks_cma,\n    aes(x = Longitude, y = Latitude),\n    alpha = 0.3,\n    size = 0.2,\n    color = \"darkgreen\"\n  ) +\n  coord_sf(xlim = c(-179.14, -50)) +\n  theme_map()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 6: A state and county-level map\nLet’s get an even higher resolution map of Starbucks locations within the states of Minnesota, Wisconsin, North Dakota, and South Dakota, with a background map at the county-level.\nPart a\nTo make this map, we again need two pieces of information.\n\nData on Starbucks for only the states of interest.\n\n\nstarbucks_midwest &lt;- starbucks |&gt; \n  filter(State.Province %in% c(\"MN\", \"ND\", \"SD\", \"WI\"))\n\n\nA background map of state- and county-level boundaries in these states. This requires st_as_sf() in the sf package, and map() in the maps package, where the countries are labeled ‘minnesota’, ‘north dakota’, etc.\n\n\n# Load packages\nlibrary(sf)\nlibrary(maps)\n\n# Get the boundaries\nmidwest_boundaries &lt;- st_as_sf(\n  maps::map(\"county\",\n            region = c(\"minnesota\", \"wisconsin\", \"north dakota\", \"south dakota\"), \n            fill = TRUE, plot = FALSE))\n\n# Check it out\nhead(midwest_boundaries)\n\nSimple feature collection with 6 features and 1 field\nGeometry type: MULTIPOLYGON\nDimension:     XY\nBounding box:  xmin: -96.81268 ymin: 45.05167 xmax: -93.01397 ymax: 48.53526\nGeodetic CRS:  +proj=longlat +ellps=clrk66 +no_defs +type=crs\n                                     ID                           geom\nminnesota,aitkin       minnesota,aitkin MULTIPOLYGON (((-93.03689 4...\nminnesota,anoka         minnesota,anoka MULTIPOLYGON (((-93.51817 4...\nminnesota,becker       minnesota,becker MULTIPOLYGON (((-95.14537 4...\nminnesota,beltrami   minnesota,beltrami MULTIPOLYGON (((-95.58655 4...\nminnesota,benton       minnesota,benton MULTIPOLYGON (((-93.77027 4...\nminnesota,big stone minnesota,big stone MULTIPOLYGON (((-96.10794 4...\n\n\nPart b\nAdjust the code below to make the plot!

Consider the Starbucks locations in Canada, Mexico, and the US that we mapped earlier:\n\n# Point map (we made this earlier)\nggplot(cma_boundaries) + \n  geom_sf() + \n  geom_point(\n    data = starbucks_cma,\n    aes(x = Longitude, y = Latitude),\n    alpha = 0.3,\n    size = 0.2,\n    color = \"darkgreen\"\n  ) +\n  coord_sf(xlim = c(-179.14, -50), ylim = c(14.54, 83.11)) +\n  theme_map()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow check out the contour map.\n\n# What changed in the plot?\n#it did these kooky area guys\n# What changed in our code?!\n#we changed it points to density_2d\nggplot(cma_boundaries) + \n  geom_sf() + \n  geom_density_2d(\n    data = starbucks_cma,\n    aes(x = Longitude, y = Latitude),\n    size = 0.2,\n    color = \"darkgreen\"\n  ) +\n  coord_sf(xlim = c(-179.14, -50), ylim = c(14.54, 83.11)) +\n  theme_map()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPart 3: Choropleth maps\nSpatial data isn’t always in the form of point locations! For example, recall the state and county-level data on presidential elections.\n\nelections_by_state &lt;-  read.csv(\"https://mac-stat.github.io/data/election_2020_by_state.csv\")\nelections_by_counties &lt;- read.csv(\"https://mac-stat.github.io/data/election_2020_county.csv\")\n\nIn these datasets, we’re interested in the overall election outcome by region (state or county), not the specific geographic location of some observation. Let’s wrangle our data first. We’ll focus on just a few variables of interest, and create a new variable (repub_20_categories) that discretizes the repub_pct_20 variable into increments of 5 percentage points (for states) or 10 percentage points (for counties):\n\n# Don't worry about the code!\n\nelections_by_state &lt;- elections_by_state |&gt; \n  filter(state_abbr != \"DC\") |&gt; \n  select(state_name, state_abbr, repub_pct_20) |&gt; \n  mutate(repub_20_categories = \n           cut(repub_pct_20, \n               breaks = seq(30, 70, by = 5), \n               labels = c(\"30-34\", \"35-39\", \"40-44\", \"45-49\",\n                          \"50-54\", \"55-59\", \"60-64\", \"65-70\"), \n               include.lowest = TRUE))\n\nelections_by_counties &lt;- elections_by_counties |&gt; \n  select(state_name, state_abbr, county_name, county_fips,\n          repub_pct_20, median_age, median_rent) |&gt; \n  mutate(repub_20_categories = \n           cut(repub_pct_20, \n               breaks = seq(0, 100, by = 10),\n               labels = c(\"0-9\", \"10-19\", \"20-29\", \"30-39\", \"40-49\",\n                          \"50-59\", \"60-69\", \"70-79\", \"80-89\", \"90-100\"),\n               include.lowest = TRUE))\n\nExercise 8: State-level choropleth maps\nLet’s map the 2020 Republican support in each state, repub_pct_20.\nPart a\nWe again need two pieces of information.\n\nData on elections in each state, which we already have: elections_by_state.\nA background map of state boundaries in the US. The boundaries we used for point maps don’t work here. (Optional detail: they’re sf objects and we now need a data.frame object.) Instead, we can use the map_data() function from the ggplot2 package:\n\n\n# Get the latitude and longitude coordinates of state boundaries\nstates_map &lt;- map_data(\"state\")\n\n# Check it out\nhead(states_map)\n\n       long      lat group order  region subregion\n1 -87.46201 30.38968     1     1 alabama      &lt;NA&gt;\n2 -87.48493 30.37249     1     2 alabama      &lt;NA&gt;\n3 -87.52503 30.37249     1     3 alabama      &lt;NA&gt;\n4 -87.53076 30.33239     1     4 alabama      &lt;NA&gt;\n5 -87.57087 30.32665     1     5 alabama      &lt;NA&gt;\n6 -87.58806 30.32665     1     6 alabama      &lt;NA&gt;\n\n\nPause\nImportant detail: Note that the region variable in states_map, and the state_name variable in elections_by_state both label states by the full name in lower case letters.

Our elections_by_counties data refers to each county by a county_fips code, which is mostly the same as id, BUT drops any 0’s at the beginning of the code.\n\nhead(county_map)\n\n     long      lat order  hole piece            group    id\n1 1225889 -1275020     1 FALSE     1 0500000US01001.1 01001\n2 1235324 -1274008     2 FALSE     1 0500000US01001.1 01001\n3 1244873 -1272331     3 FALSE     1 0500000US01001.1 01001\n4 1244129 -1267515     4 FALSE     1 0500000US01001.1 01001\n5 1272010 -1262889     5 FALSE     1 0500000US01001.1 01001\n6 1276797 -1295514     6 FALSE     1 0500000US01001.1 01001\n\nhead(elections_by_counties)\n\n  state_name state_abbr    county_name county_fips repub_pct_20 median_age\n1    Alabama         AL Autauga County        1001        71.44       37.5\n2    Alabama         AL Baldwin County        1003        76.17       41.5\n3    Alabama         AL Barbour County        1005        53.45       38.3\n4    Alabama         AL    Bibb County        1007        78.43       39.4\n5    Alabama         AL  Blount County        1009        89.57       39.6\n6    Alabama         AL Bullock County        1011        24.84       39.6\n  median_rent repub_20_categories\n1         668               70-79\n2         693               70-79\n3         382               50-59\n4         351               70-79\n5         403               80-89\n6         276               20-29\n\n\nThis just means that we have to wrangle the data so that it can communicate with the background map.\n\n# Add 0's at the beginning of any fips_code that's fewer than 5 numbers long\n# Don't worry about the syntax\nelections_by_counties &lt;- elections_by_counties |&gt; \n  mutate(county_fips = as.character(county_fips)) |&gt; \n  mutate(county_fips = \n           ifelse(nchar(county_fips) == 4, paste0(\"0\", county_fips), county_fips))\n\nPart b\nNow map Republican support by county.

But let’s rethink the 10% – data wrangling is a fun and empowering puzzle!\n\nThe goals of data wrangling are to explore how to:\n\nGet data into the tidy shape / format we need for analysis. For example, we might want to:\n\nkeep only certain observations\ndefine new variables\nreformat or “clean” existing variables\ncombine various datasets\nprocess “string” or text data\n\n\nNumerically (not just visually) explore and summarize various characteristics of the variables in our dataset.",

    "text": "11.4 Warm-Up\nThere are lots and lots of steps that can go into data wrangling, thus lots and lots of relevant R functions. BUT just 6 functions can get us very far. People refer to these as the 6 main wrangling verbs or functions:\n\nwhy “verbs”? in the tidyverse grammar, functions serve as action words\n\nthe 6 verbs are all stored in the dplyr package within the tidyverse\n\neach verb acts on a data frame and returns a data frame\n\n\n\nverb\naction\n\n\n\narrange\n\narrange the rows according to some column\n\n\n\nfilter\n\nfilter out or obtain a subset of the rows\n\n\n\nselect\n\nselect a subset of columns\n\n\n\nmutate\n\nmutate or create a column\n\n\n\nsummarize\ncalculate a numerical summary of a column\n\n\n\ngroup_by\n\ngroup the rows by a specified column\n\n\n\n\n\n11.4.1 Example 1\nWhich verb would help us…\n\nkeep only information about state names, county names, and the 2020 and 2016 Democratic support (not the 2012 results, demographics, etc)\n\nSelect, we would view the subset of those few columns\n\nget only the data on Minnesota\n\nfilter\n\ndefine a new variable which calculates the change in Democratic support from 2016 to 2020, using dem_pct_20 and dem_pct_16\n\n\nmutate (or summarize, although it would be seperate)\n\nsort the counties from highest to lowest Democratic support\n\narrange\n\ndetermine the total number of votes cast across all counties\n\nsummarize (or mutate, but it would be with everything else)\n\n11.4.2 Example 2: Select Columns\nTo get a sense for the code structure, let’s explore a couple verbs together. To start, let’s simplify our dataset to include only some variables of interest. Specifically, select() only the columns relevant to state names, county names, and the 2020 and 2016 Democratic support:\n\n# What's the first argument? The second?\n#is the point here that its hard to tell? certainly theres sort of sub-arguments\nselect(elections, c(state_name, county_name, dem_pct_20, dem_pct_16))\n\nLet’s re-do this with the pipe function |&gt;:\n\nelections |&gt; \n  select(state_name, county_name, dem_pct_20, dem_pct_16)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPipe Function |&gt;\n\n\n\n|&gt; “passes” objects, usually datasets, to a function:\nobject |&gt; function() is the same as function(object)\n\n\n\n11.4.3 Example 3: Filter Rows\nLet’s filter() out only the rows related to Minnesota (MN):\n\n# Without a pipe\nfilter(elections, state_name == \"Minnesota\")\n\n\n# With a pipe\nelections |&gt; \n  filter(state_name == \"Minnesota\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n== vs =\n\n\n\nWe use a == b to check whether a matches b.\nWe use a = b to define that a is equal to b. We typically use = for this purpose inside a function, and &lt;- for this purpose outside a function.\n\n# Ex: \"=\" defines x\nx = 2\nx\n\n[1] 2\n\n\n\n# Ex: \"==\" checks whether x is/matches 3\nx == 3\n\n[1] FALSE\n\n\n\n\n\n11.4.4 Example 4: Filter and Select\nLet’s combine select() and filter() to create a new dataset with info about the county names, and 2020 and 2016 Democratic support among Minnesota counties.\n\n# Without pipes\nfilter(select(elections, c(state_name, county_name, dem_pct_20, dem_pct_16)), state_name == \"Minnesota\")\n\n\n# With pipes: all verbs in 1 row\nelections |&gt; select(state_name, county_name, dem_pct_20, dem_pct_16) |&gt; filter(state_name == \"Minnesota\")\n\n\n# With pipes: each verb in a new row\nelections |&gt; \n  select(state_name, county_name, dem_pct_20, dem_pct_16) |&gt; \n  filter(state_name == \"Minnesota\")\n\n\n# We can even do this with UN-tidyverse code in \"base\" R\nelections[elections$state_name == \"Minnesota\", c(1, 4, 8, 12)]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReflection\n\n\n\nWhy will we typically use:\n\ntidyverse code\nthe pipe function |&gt;\n\neach verb on a new row\n\n\n\n\n11.4.5 Example 5: Order of Operations\nSometimes, the order of operations matters, eg, putting on socks then shoes produces a different result than putting on shoes then socks. However, sometimes order doesn’t matter, eg, pouring cereal into a bowl then adding milk produces the same result as pouring milk into a bow then adding cereal (though one order is obviously better than the other ;)) Above (also copied below), we selected some columns and then filtered some rows:\n\nelections |&gt; \n  select(state_name, county_name, dem_pct_20, dem_pct_16) |&gt; \n  filter(state_name == \"Minnesota\")\n\nWould we get the same result if we reversed select() and filter()? Think first, then try it.\n\n# Try it\nelections |&gt;\n   filter(state_name == \"Minnesota\") |&gt;\n   select(state_name, county_name, dem_pct_20, dem_pct_16)\n\n   state_name

This dataset should include the following variables (and only these variables): state_name, county_name, dem_pct_20, dem_pct_16, and a variable measuring the change in Democratic vote percentage in 2020 vs 2016.\n\n# Define the dataset\nmn_wi&lt;- elections_small|&gt;\n  filter(state_name %in% c(\"Minnesota\", \"Wisconsin\")) |&gt;\n  mutate (\"dem_chng_16_20\" = dem_pct_20-dem_pct_16) |&gt;\n  select(state_name, county_name, dem_pct_20, dem_pct_16, dem_chng_16_20) |&gt;\n  arrange(dem_chng_16_20)\n# Only store the results once you're confident that they're correct\n\n\n# Check out the first 6 rows to confirm your results\nhead(mn_wi)\n\n  state_name        county_name dem_pct_20 dem_pct_16 dem_chng_16_20\n1  Minnesota     Stevens County      37.80      39.55          -1.75\n2  Wisconsin      Forest County      34.06      35.12          -1.06\n3  Wisconsin    Kewaunee County      32.87      33.73          -0.86\n4  Wisconsin       Clark County      30.37      31.19          -0.82\n5  Wisconsin       Adams County      36.63      37.40          -0.77\n6  Wisconsin Trempealeau County      40.86      41.57          -0.71\n\n\nPart c\nConstruct and discuss a plot of the county-level change in Democratic vote percent in 2020 vs 2016, and how this differs between Minnesota and Wisconsin.\nIn Minnesota, the most common change in vote percentage was somewhere around 2.6% percent more Democratic from 2016 to 2020 in a given county. However, it there is also somewhat of a positive skew which means there was a significant number of counties with 7.5 to 5 percent increases in democratic vote percentage. In Wisconsin, on the other hand, the mode rested somewhere much closer to a 1% increases, and there was a significant number of counties where democratic vote percentage decreased, usually by something like .75%. there remains a positive skew, but it doesn’t plateau as much as minnesorta, and there are many wisconsin counties with more than a 3.5% increase in democratic vote percentage\n\nggplot(mn_wi, aes(x=dem_chng_16_20)) +\n  geom_histogram(color=\"white\", fill=\"magenta2\", binwidth=.4) +\n  facet_wrap(~ state_name)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 7: summarize Demo\n6 verbs: select, filter, arrange, mutate, summarize, group_by\nLet’s talk about the last 2 verbs. summarize() (or equivalently summarise()) takes an entire data frame as input and outputs a single row with one or more summary statistics. For each chunk below, indicate what the code does.\n\n# What does this do?\n# It finds the median value between all counties of the repub voting pct\n elections_small |&gt; \n   summarize(median(repub_pct_20))\n\n  median(repub_pct_20)\n1                68.29\n\n\n\n# What does this do?\n# The same thing as above, but renames the variable median_repub\n elections_small |&gt; \n   summarize(median_repub = median(repub_pct_20))\n\n  median_repub\n1        68.29\n\n\n\n# What does this do?\n#In addition to this median variable, creates another new varriable that is the sum of all votes in the country in 2020\n elections_small |&gt; \n   summarize(median_repub = median(repub_pct_20), total_votes = sum(total_votes_20))\n\n  median_repub total_votes\n1        68.29   157949293\n\n\nExercise 8: summarize + group_by demo\nFinally, group_by() groups the units of observation or rows of a data frame by a specified set of variables. Alone, this function doesn’t change the appearance of our dataset or seem to do anything at all:\n\n elections_small |&gt; \n  group_by(state_name)\n\n# A tibble: 3,109 × 7\n# Groups:   state_name [50]\n   state_name county_name  total_votes_20 repub_pct_20 dem_pct_20 total_votes_16\n   &lt;chr&gt;      &lt;chr&gt;                 &lt;int&gt;        &lt;dbl&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt;          &lt;int&gt;\n 1 Alabama    Autauga Cou…          27770         71.4      27.0           24661\n 2 Alabama    Baldwin Cou…         109679         76.2      22.4           94090\n 3 Alabama    Barbour Cou…          10518         53.4      45.8           10390\n 4 Alabama    Bibb County            9595         78.4      20.7            8748\n 5 Alabama    Blount Coun…          27588         89.6       9.57          25384\n 6 Alabama    Bullock Cou…           4613         24.8      74.7            4701\n 7 Alabama    Butler Coun…           9488         57.5      41.8            8685\n 8 Alabama    Calhoun Cou…          50983         68.8      29.8           47376\n 9 Alabama    Chambers Co…          15284         57.3      41.6           13778\n10 Alabama    Cherokee Co…          12301         86.0      13.2           10503\n# ℹ 3,099 more rows\n# ℹ 1 more variable: dem_pct_16 &lt;dbl&gt;\n\n\nThough it does change the underlying structure of the dataset:\n\n# Check out the structure before and after group_by\n elections_small |&gt; \n   class()\n\n[1] \"data.frame\"\n\n# \n elections_small |&gt; \n  group_by(state_name) |&gt; \n   class()\n\n[1] \"grouped_df\" \"tbl_df\"     \"tbl\"        \"data.frame\"\n\n\nWhere it really shines is in partnership with summarize().\n\n# What does this do?\n#essentially, it organizes the data for each state together, and so functions like summarize operate within each group\n# (What if we didn't use group_by?)\n elections_small |&gt; \n   group_by(state_name) |&gt; \n   summarize(median_repub = median(repub_pct_20), total_votes = sum(total_votes_20)) \n\n# A tibble: 50 × 3\n   state_name           median_repub total_votes\n   &lt;chr&gt;                       &lt;dbl&gt;       &lt;int&gt;\n 1 Alabama                      70.6     2323304\n 2 Arizona                      57.9     3387326\n 3 Arkansas                     72.1     1219069\n 4 California                   44.8    17495906\n 5 Colorado                     56.2     3256953\n 6 Connecticut                  41.0     1824280\n 7 Delaware                     47.1      504010\n 8 District of Columbia          5.4      344356\n 9 Florida                      64.6    11067456\n10 Georgia                      68       4997716\n# ℹ 40 more rows\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReflect\n\n\n\nNotice that group_by() with summarize() produces new data frame or tibble!

The right approach depends upon your research goals. A general rule is: Only get rid of observations with missing data if they’re missing data on variables you need for the specific task at hand!\n\n\nExample 1\nSuppose our research focus is just on body_mass_g. Two penguins are missing this info:\n\n# NOTE the use of is.na()\npenguins |&gt; \n  summarize(sum(is.na(body_mass_g)))\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 1\n  `sum(is.na(body_mass_g))`\n                      &lt;int&gt;\n1                         2\n\n\nLet’s define a new dataset that removes these penguins:\n\n# NOTE the use of is.na()\npenguins_w_body_mass &lt;- penguins |&gt; \n  filter(!is.na(body_mass_g))\n\n# Compare the number of penguins in this vs the original data\nnrow(penguins_w_body_mass)\n\n[1] 342\n\nnrow(penguins)\n\n[1] 344\n\n\nNote that some penguins in penguins_w_body_mass are missing info on sex, but we don’t care since that’s not related to our research question:\n\npenguins_w_body_mass |&gt; \n  summarize(sum(is.na(sex)))\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 1\n  `sum(is.na(sex))`\n              &lt;int&gt;\n1                 9\n\n\nExample 2\nIn the very rare case that we need complete information on every variable for the specific task at hand, we can use na.omit() to get rid of any penguin that’s missing info on any variable:\n\npenguins_complete &lt;- penguins |&gt; \n  na.omit()\n\nHow many penguins did this eliminate?\n\nnrow(penguins_complete)\n\n[1] 333\n\nnrow(penguins)\n\n[1] 344\n\n\nPart c\nExplain why we should only use na.omit() in extreme circumstances.\n Because it can dramatically cut down the amount of data we have, and remove crucial points, even if the places where the NA are are not relevant to analysis\nExercise 2: More Selecting\nBeing able to select() only certain columns can help simplify our data. This is especially important when we’re working with lots of columns (which we haven’t done yet). It can also get tedious to type out every column of interest. Here are some shortcuts:\n\n\n- removes a given variable and keeps all others (e.g. select(-island))\n\nstarts_with(\"___\"), ends_with(\"___\"), or contains(\"___\") selects only the columns that either start with, end with, or simply contain the given string of characters\n\nUse these shortcuts to create the following datasets.\n\n# First: recall the variable names\nnames(penguins)\n\n[1] \"species\"           \"island\"            \"bill_length_mm\"   \n[4] \"bill_depth_mm\"     \"flipper_length_mm\" \"body_mass_g\"      \n[7] \"sex\"               \"year\"             \n\n\n\n# Use a shortcut to keep everything but the year and island variables\npenguins |&gt;\n  select(-island,-year)\n\n# A tibble: 344 × 6\n   species bill_length_mm bill_depth_mm flipper_length_mm body_mass_g sex   \n   &lt;chr&gt;            &lt;dbl&gt;         &lt;dbl&gt;             &lt;dbl&gt;       &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; \n 1 Adelie            39.1          18.7               181        3750 male  \n 2 Adelie            39.5          17.4               186        3800 female\n 3 Adelie            40.3          18                 195        3250 female\n 4 Adelie            NA            NA                  NA          NA &lt;NA&gt;  \n 5 Adelie            36.7          19.3               193        3450 female\n 6 Adelie            39.3          20.6               190        3650 male  \n 7 Adelie            38.9          17.8               181        3625 female\n 8 Adelie            39.2          19.6               195        4675 male  \n 9 Adelie            34.1          18.1               193        3475 &lt;NA&gt;  \n10 Adelie            42            20.2               190        4250 &lt;NA&gt;  \n# ℹ 334 more rows\n\n\n\n# Use a shortcut to keep only species and the penguin characteristics measured in mm\npenguins |&gt;\n  select(species,ends_with(\"mm\"))\n\n# A tibble: 344 × 4\n   species bill_length_mm bill_depth_mm flipper_length_mm\n   &lt;chr&gt;            &lt;dbl&gt;         &lt;dbl&gt;             &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1 Adelie            39.1          18.7               181\n 2 Adelie            39.5          17.4               186\n 3 Adelie            40.3          18                 195\n 4 Adelie            NA            NA                  NA\n 5 Adelie            36.7          19.3               193\n 6 Adelie            39.3          20.6               190\n 7 Adelie            38.9          17.8               181\n 8 Adelie            39.2          19.6               195\n 9 Adelie            34.1          18.1               193\n10 Adelie            42            20.2               190\n# ℹ 334 more rows\n\n\n\n# Use a shortcut to keep only species and bill-related measurements\npenguins |&gt;\n  select(species,starts_with(\"bill\"))\n\n# A tibble: 344 × 3\n   species bill_length_mm bill_depth_mm\n   &lt;chr&gt;            &lt;dbl&gt;         &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1 Adelie            39.1          18.7\n 2 Adelie            39.5          17.4\n 3 Adelie            40.3          18  \n 4 Adelie            NA            NA  \n 5 Adelie            36.7          19.3\n 6 Adelie            39.3          20.6\n 7 Adelie            38.9          17.8\n 8 Adelie            39.2          19.6\n 9 Adelie            34.1          18.1\n10 Adelie            42            20.2\n# ℹ 334 more rows\n\n\n\n# Use a shortcut to keep only species and the length-related characteristics\npenguins |&gt;\n  select(species,contains(\"length\"))\n\n# A tibble: 344 × 3\n   species bill_length_mm flipper_length_mm\n   &lt;chr&gt;            &lt;dbl&gt;             &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1 Adelie            39.1               181\n 2 Adelie            39.5               186\n 3 Adelie            40.3               195\n 4 Adelie            NA                  NA\n 5 Adelie            36.7               193\n 6 Adelie            39.3               190\n 7 Adelie            38.9               181\n 8 Adelie            39.2               195\n 9 Adelie            34.1               193\n10 Adelie            42                 190\n# ℹ 334 more rows\n\n\n\nExercise 3: Arranging, Counting, & Grouping by Multiple Variables\nWe’ve done examples where we need to filter() by more than one variable, or select() more than one variable.

Dates are a whole special object type or class in R that automatically respect the order of time.\n\n# Get today's date\nas.Date(today())\n\n[1] \"2025-03-26\"\n\n# Let's store this as \"today\" so we can work with it below\ntoday &lt;- as.Date(today())\n\n# Check out the class of this object\nclass(today)\n\n[1] \"Date\"\n\n\nThe lubridate package inside tidyverse contains functions that can extract various information from dates. Let’s learn about some of the most common functions by applying them to today. For each, make a comment on what the function does\n\nyear(today)\n\n[1] 2025\n\n#year() extracts the year from the date, as a number\n\n\n# What do these lines produce / what's their difference?\n#month() extracts the month from a date as a number, while month(label=TRUE) extracts it as a 3 letter abbreviation of the month name, specifically, as an ordinal factor\nmonth(today)\n\n[1] 3\n\nmonth(today, label = TRUE)\n\n[1] Mar\n12 Levels: Jan &lt; Feb &lt; Mar &lt; Apr &lt; May &lt; Jun &lt; Jul &lt; Aug &lt; Sep &lt; ... &lt; Dec\n\nmonth(today, label = TRUE) |&gt; class()\n\n[1] \"ordered\" \"factor\" \n\n\n\n# What does this number mean?\n#week() records how many weeks have passed in the year, but it conflicts with things like a googled ISO recording of week number, which counts any week that at least includes thursday. it may only count \"full\" weeks starting on sunday.\nweek(today)\n\n[1] 13\n\n\n\n# What do these lines produce / what's their difference?\n#mday() extracts the day of the month, and yday() extracts the day of the year\nmday(today)\n\n[1] 26\n\nyday(today)  # This is often called the \"Julian day\"\n\n[1] 85\n\n\n\n# What do these lines produce / what's their difference?\n#wday() extracts the number of the day of the week, if we consider a week as starting on sunday, while wday(label=TRUE) extracts the day of the week as a 3 letter abbreviation, again an ordinal factor\nwday(today)\n\n[1] 4\n\nwday(today, label = TRUE)\n\n[1] Wed\nLevels: Sun &lt; Mon &lt; Tue &lt; Wed &lt; Thu &lt; Fri &lt; Sat\n\nwday(today, label = TRUE) |&gt; class()\n\n[1] \"ordered\" \"factor\" \n\n\n\n# What do the results of these 2 lines tell us?\n#that dates are considered greater than eachother if they come after eachother\ntoday &gt;= ymd(\"2024-02-14\")\n\n[1] TRUE\n\ntoday &lt; ymd(\"2024-02-14\")\n\n[1] FALSE",

We can use our wrangling skills to understand some drivers of daily births. Putting these all together can be challenging! Remember the following ways to make tasks more manageable:\n\nTranslate the prompt into our 6 verbs (and count()). That is, think before you type.\nBuild your code line by line. It’s important to understand what’s being piped into each function!\n\nExercise 5: Warming up\n\n# How many days of data do we have for each state?\nBirthdays |&gt;\n  group_by(state) |&gt;\n  count()\n\n# A tibble: 51 × 2\n# Groups:   state [51]\n   state     n\n   &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt;\n 1 AK     7306\n 2 AL     7312\n 3 AR     7310\n 4 AZ     7310\n 5 CA     7325\n 6 CO     7305\n 7 CT     7312\n 8 DC     7311\n 9 DE     7307\n10 FL     7307\n# ℹ 41 more rows\n\n# How many total births were there in this time period?\nBirthdays |&gt;\n  summarize(sum(births))\n\n  sum(births)\n1    70486538\n\n# How many total births were there per state in this time period, sorted from low to high?\nBirthdays |&gt;\n  group_by(state) |&gt;\n  summarize(total=sum(births)) |&gt;\n  arrange(total)\n\n# A tibble: 51 × 2\n   state  total\n   &lt;chr&gt;  &lt;int&gt;\n 1 VT    147886\n 2 WY    154019\n 3 AK    185385\n 4 DE    188705\n 5 SD    235734\n 6 ND    238696\n 7 NV    241470\n 8 MT    253884\n 9 NH    264984\n10 RI    265038\n# ℹ 41 more rows\n\n\nExercise 6: Homework Reprise\nCreate a new dataset named daily_births that includes the total number of births per day (across all states) and the corresponding day of the week, eg, Mon.

Then, plot the births by month and comment on what you learn. ::: {.callout-tip title=“Xtra notes on Dates and (Ordered) Factors”} You can use as.Date() to change character or numeric strings into dates! Still looking on how to combine ordinal factors, though (and change integers thereof?) It’s fairly difficult to combine ordered factors but the forcats package should be of some help. The fct_c() and fct_cross() functions are for just that! https://forcats.tidyverse.org/reference/index.html To actually make the integer year into a ordered factor is a whole other problem, but involves the native r functions factor() or ordered() :::\n\nlibrary(ggridges)\nmonthly_births &lt;- Birthdays  |&gt;\n  mutate(mon_lab=month(date, label=TRUE)) |&gt;\n  group_by(year,mon_lab) |&gt;\n  summarize(mon_birth=sum(births))\n\nmonthly_births\n\n# A tibble: 240 × 3\n# Groups:   year [20]\n    year mon_lab mon_birth\n   &lt;int&gt; &lt;ord&gt;       &lt;int&gt;\n 1  1969 Jan        293876\n 2  1969 Feb        270534\n 3  1969 Mar        296598\n 4  1969 Apr        282470\n 5  1969 May        289070\n 6  1969 Jun        291448\n 7  1969 Jul        318348\n 8  1969 Aug        320922\n 9  1969 Sep        312444\n10  1969 Oct        311944\n# ℹ 230 more rows\n\nggplot(monthly_births,aes(x=mon_birth,y=mon_lab)) +\n  geom_density_ridges()\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(monthly_births) +\n  geom_point(aes(y=mon_birth,x=mon_lab)) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n#It seems that July, August, and September usually seem to have the most births, while November and February tend to have the least\n\nPart b\nIn 1988, calculate the total number of births per week in each state. Get rid of week “53”, which isn’t a complete week! Then, make a line plot of births by week for each state and comment on what you learn. For example, do you notice any seasonal trends? Are these the same in every state? Any outliers?\nIts harder to see trends in the smaller states, but it seems that births peak from week 30 (around mid-late July) to week 40 (the end of September). This is most pronounce in California, with a steady peak centering around a maximum at week 38. Outliers are somewhat hard to see in this dataset, but Illinois seems to peak around week 12 (Mid-late March, that is, now!)\n\nweekly_births &lt;- Birthdays |&gt;\n  filter(year==1988) |&gt;\n  mutate(week=week(date)) |&gt;\n  filter(week!=53) |&gt;\n  group_by(state,week) |&gt;\n  summarize(wk_birth=sum(births))\nweekly_births |&gt;\narrange(desc(wk_birth))\n\n# A tibble: 2,652 × 3\n# Groups:   state [51]\n   state  week wk_birth\n   &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;int&gt;\n 1 CA       38    11396\n 2 CA       39    11262\n 3 CA       37    11042\n 4 CA       34    10958\n 5 CA       40    10931\n 6 CA       35    10763\n 7 CA       36    10757\n 8 CA       32    10752\n 9 CA       33    10751\n10 CA       21    10582\n# ℹ 2,642 more rows\n\nmax(weekly_births$wk_birth)\n\n[1] 11396\n\nggplot(weekly_births, aes(x=week,y=wk_birth,color=state)) +\n  geom_line(linewidth=0.4)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPart c\nRepeat the above for just Minnesota (MN) and Louisiana (LA). MN has one of the coldest climates and LA has one of the warmest. How do their seasonal trends compare? Do you think these trends are similar in other colder and warmer states? Try it! In Louisiana, the aforementioned July-September birth peak is much more pronounced, and there is also a fairly pronounced valley between March and early June. In MN, on the other hand, births stay much more steady, and mostly just drop surrounding the new year. A state like Wisconsin shows both this New Years drop off and summer peak, which here starts in mid May, while while somewhere like Arizona, while much less consistent, shows some shakey signs of this summertime peak\n\nweekly_births |&gt;\n  filter(state%in% c(\"MN\",\"LA\")) |&gt;\nggplot(aes(x=week,y=wk_birth,color=state)) +\n  geom_line(linewidth=0.4)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nweekly_births |&gt;\n

    "text": "13.2 Data Import\nStarting Data Project\nAny data science project consists of two phases:\n\n\nData Collection\nA data project starts with data! Thus far, you’ve either been given data, or used TidyTuesday data. In this unit:\n\nWe WILL explore how to find data, save data, import this data into RStudio, and do some preliminary data cleaning.\nWe will NOT discuss how to collect data from scratch (e.g. via experiment, observational study, or survey).\n\n\n\nData Analysis\nOnce we have data, we need to do some analysis. In this unit…\n\nWe WILL bring together our wrangling & visualization tools to discuss exploratory data analysis (EDA). EDA is the process of getting to know our data, obtaining insights from data, and using these insights to formulate, refine, and explore research questions.\nWe will NOT explore other types of analysis, such as modeling & prediction–if interested, take STAT 155 and 253 to learn more about these topics.\n\n\n\nNOTE: These skills are best learned through practice. We’ll just scratch the surface here.\nFile Formats\nBefore exploring how to find, store, import, check, and clean data, it’s important to recognize that data can be stored in various formats. We’ve been working with .csv files. In the background, these have “comma-separated values” (csv):\n\nBut there are many other common file types. For example, the following are compatible with R:\n\nExcel files: .xls, .xlsx\n\nR “data serialization” files: .rds\n\nfiles with tab-separated values: .tsv\n\n\n\nSTEP 1: Find Data\nCheck the Datasets page for information about how to find a dataset that fits your needs.\nSTEP 2: Save Data Locally\nUnless we’re just doing a quick, one-off data analysis, it’s important to store a local copy of a data file, i.e. save the data file to our own machine.\nMainly, we shouldn’t rely on another person / institution to store a data file online, in the same place, forever!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecommendations when Saving Data\n\n\n\nWhen saving your data, make sure they are\n\nin a nice format, eg, a csv file format\nwhere you’ll be able to find it again\nideally, within a folder that’s dedicated to the related project / assignment\nalongside the qmd file(s) where you’ll record your analysis of the data\n\n\n\nSTEP 3: Import Data to RStudio\nOnce we have a local copy of our data file, we need to get it into RStudio! This process depends on 2 things: (1) the file type (e.g. .csv); and (2) the file location, i.e. where it’s stored on your computer.\n1. FILE TYPE\nThe file type indicates which function we’ll need to import it. The table below lists some common import functions and when to use them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFunction\nData file type\n\n\n\nread_csv()\n.csv - you can save Excel files and Google Sheets as .csv\n\n\nread_delim()\nother delimited formats (tab, space, etc.)\n\n\nread_sheet()\nGoogle Sheet\n\n\nst_read()\nspatial data shapefile\n\n\n\nNOTE: In comparison to read.csv, read_csv is faster when importing large data files and can more easily parse complicated datasets, eg, with dates, times, percentages.\n2. FILE LOCATION\nTo import the data, we apply the appropriate function from above to the file path.\nA file path is an address to where the file is stored on our computer or the web.\nConsider “1600 Grand Ave, St. Paul, MN 55105”. Think about how different parts of the address give increasingly more specific information about the location. “St. Paul, MN 55105” tells us the city and smaller region within the city, “Grand Ave” tells us the street, and “1600” tells us the specific location on the street.\nIn the example below, the file path is absolute where it tells us the location giving more and more specific information as you read it from left to right.\n\n“~”, on an Apple computer, tells you that you are looking in the user’s home directory.\n“Desktop” tells you to go to the Desktop within that home directory.\n“112” tells you that you are looking in the 112 folder on the Desktop.\n“data” tells you to next go in the data folder in the 112 folder.\n“my_data.csv” tells you that you are looking for a file called my_data.csv location within the data folder.\n\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nmy_data &lt;- read_csv(\"~/Desktop/112/data/my_data.csv\")\n\nAbsolute file paths should only be used when reading files hosted on the web. Otherwise, relative file paths should be used. Relative file paths as the name suggest is relative to the file where the data file is read.\n\n# assume the code containing this script is under a folder called /src which\n# is at the same level of the /data folder\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nmy_data &lt;- read_csv(\"../data/my_data.csv\")\n\nSTEP 4: Check & Clean Data\nOnce the data is loaded, ask yourself a few questions:\nWhat’s the structure of the data?\n\nUse str() to learn about the numbers of variables and observations as well as the classes or types of variables (date, location, string, factor, number, boolean, etc.)\nUse head() to view the top of the data table\nUse View() to view the data in a spreadsheet-like viewer, use this command in the Console but don’t include it in your qmd files since it will prevent your project from rendering.\n\nIs there anything goofy that we need to clean before we can analyze the data?\n\nIs it in a tidy format?\nHow many rows are there? What does the row mean? What is an observation?\nIs there consistent formatting for categorical variables?\nIs there missing data that needs to be addressed?\nSTEP 5: Understand Data\nStart by understanding the data that is available to you. If you have a codebook, you have struck gold! If not (the more common case), you’ll need to do some detective work that often involves talking to people.\nAt this stage, ask yourself:\n\nWhere does my data come from? How was it collected?1\n\nIs there a codebook? If not, how can I learn more about it?\nAre there people I can reach out to who have experience with this data?",

    "text": "13.3 Exercises\nSuppose our goal is to work with data on movie reviews, and that we’ve already gone through the work to find a dataset. The imdb_5000_messy.csv file is posted on Moodle. Let’s work with it!\nExercise 1: Save Data Locally\nPart a\nOn your laptop:\n\nDownload the “imdb_5000_messy.csv” file from Moodle\nMove it to the data folder in your portfolio repository\nPart b\nHot tip: After saving your data file, it’s important to record appropriate citations and info in either a new qmd (eg: “imdb_5000_messy_README.qmd”) or in the qmd where you’ll analyze the data. These citations should include:\n\nthe data source, i.e. where you found the data\nthe data creator, i.e. who / what group collected the original data\npossibly a data codebook, i.e. descriptions of the data variables\n\nTo this end, check out where we originally got our IMDB data:\nhttps://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata\nAfter visiting that website, take some quick notes here on the data source and creator.\nData was compiled by Kaggle, a data science learning site, from a movie database called TMBd, using their included API\nExercise 2: Import Data to RStudio\nNow that we have a local copy of our data file, let’s get it into RStudio! Remember that this process depends on 2 things: the file type and location. Since our file type is a csv, we can import it using read_csv(). But we have to supply the file location through a file path. To this end, we can either use an absolute file path or a relative file path.\nPart a\nAn absolute file path describes the location of a file starting from the root or home directory. How we refer to the user root directory depends upon your machine:\n\nOn a Mac: ~\n\nOn Windows: typically C:\\\n\n\nThen the complete file path to the IMDB data file in the data folder, depending on your machine an where you created your portfolio project, can be:\n\nOn a Mac: ~/Desktop/portfolio/data/imdb_5000_messy.csv\n\nOn Windows: C:\\Desktop\\portfolio\\data\\imdb_5000_messy.csv or C:\\\\Desktop\\\\portfolio\\\\data\\\\imdb_5000_messy.csv\n\n\nPutting this together, use read_csv() with the appropriate absolute file path to import your data into RStudio. Save this as imdb_messy.\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nimdb_messy &lt;- read_csv(\"C:\\\\Users\\\\merce\\\\Documents\\\\MAC sophmore year\\\\data science\\\\portfolio\\\\portfolio-LilStoopitPepole\\\\data\\\\imdb_5000_messy.csv\")\n\nPart b\nAbsolute file paths can get really long, depending upon our number of sub-folders, and they should not be used when sharing code with other and instead relative file paths should be used. A relative file path describes the location of a file from the current “working directory”, i.e. where RStudio would currently look for on your computer. Check what your working directory is inside this qmd:\n\n# This should be the folder where you stored this qmd!\ngetwd()\n\n[1] \"C:/Users/merce/Documents/MAC sophmore year/data science/portfolio/portfolio-LilStoopitPepole/ica\"\n\n\nNext, check what the working directory is for the console by typing getwd() in the console. This is probably different, meaning that the relative file paths that will work in your qmd won’t work in the console! You can either exclusively work inside your qmd (THIS IS WHAT I NORMALLY DO ANYWAYS I DON’T USE THE CONSOLE FOR ANYTHING), or change the working directory in your console, by navigating to the following in the upper toolbar: Session &gt; Set Working Directory &gt; To Source File location.\nPart c\nAs a good practice, we created a data folder and saved our data file (imdb_5000_messy.csv) into.\nSince our .qmd analysis and .csv data live in the same project, we don’t have to write out absolute file paths that go all the way to the root directory. We can use relative file paths that start from where our code file exists to where the data file exist:\n\nOn a Mac: ../data/imdb_5000_messy.csv\n\nOn Windows: ..\\data\\imdb_5000_messy.csv or ..\\\\data\\\\imdb_5000_messy.csv\n\n\nNOTE: .. means go up one level in the file hierarchy, ie, go to the parent folder/directory.\nPutting this together, use read_csv() with the appropriate relative file path to import your data into RStudio. Save this as imdb_temp (temp for “temporary”). Convince yourself that this worked, i.e. you get the same dataset as imdb_messy.\n\nimdb_temp &lt;- read_csv(\"..\\\\data\\\\imdb_5000_messy.csv\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFile Paths\n\n\n\nAbsolute file paths should be used when referring to files hosed on the web, eg, https://mac-stat.github.io/data/kiva_partners2.csv. In all other instances, relative file paths should be used.\n\n\nPart d: OPTIONAL\nSometimes, we don’t want to import the entire dataset. For example, we might want to…\n\nskips some rows, eg, if they’re just “filler”\nonly import the first “n” rows, eg, if the dataset is really large\nonly import a random subset of “n” rows, eg, if the dataset is really large\n\nThe “data import cheat sheet” at the top of this qmd, or Google, are handy resources here. As one example…\n\n# Try importing only the first 5 rows\n read_csv(\"..\\\\data\\\\imdb_5000_messy.csv\", n_max = 5)\n\n# A tibble: 5 × 29\n   ...1 color director_name     num_critic_for_reviews duration\n  &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt;                              &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;\n1     1 Color James Cameron                        723      178\n2     2 Color Gore Verbinski                       302      169\n3     3 Color Sam Mendes                           602      148\n4     4 Color Christopher Nolan                    813      164\n5     5 &lt;NA&gt;  Doug Walker                           NA       NA\n# ℹ 24 more variables: director_facebook_likes &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   actor_3_facebook_likes &lt;dbl&gt;, actor_2_name &lt;chr&gt;,\n#   actor_1_facebook_likes &lt;dbl&gt;, gross &lt;dbl&gt;, genres &lt;chr&gt;,\n#   actor_1_name &lt;chr&gt;, movie_title &lt;chr&gt;, num_voted_users &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   cast_total_facebook_likes &lt;dbl&gt;, actor_3_name &lt;chr&gt;,\n#   facenumber_in_poster &lt;dbl&gt;, plot_keywords &lt;chr&gt;, movie_imdb_link &lt;chr&gt;,\n#   num_user_for_reviews &lt;dbl&gt;, language &lt;chr&gt;, country &lt;chr&gt;, …\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCommenting/Uncommenting Code\n\n\n\nTo comment/uncomment several lines of code at once, highlight them then click ctrl/cmd+shift+c.\n\n\nExercise 3: Check Data\nAfter importing new data into RStudio, you MUST do some quick checks of the data. Here are two first steps that are especially useful.\nPart a\nOpen imdb_messy in the spreadsheet-like viewer by typing View(imdb_messy) in the console. Sort this “spreadsheet” by different variables by clicking on the arrows next to the variable names. Do you notice anything unexpected?\nPart b\nDo a quick summary() of each variable in the dataset. One way to do this is below:\n\n imdb_messy |&gt;\n  mutate(across(where(is.character), as.factor)) |&gt;  \n  # convert characters to factors in order to summarize\n  summary()\n\n      ...1                  color               director_name \n Min.   :   1   B&W            :  10   Steven Spielberg:  26  \n 1st Qu.:1262   Black and White: 199   Woody Allen     :  22  \n Median :2522   color          :  30   Clint Eastwood  :  20  \n Mean   :2522   Color          :4755   Martin Scorsese :  20  \n 3rd Qu.:3782   COLOR          :  30   Ridley Scott    :  17  \n Max.   :5043   NA's           :  19   (Other)         :4834  \n                                       NA's            : 104  \n num_critic_for_reviews    duration     director_facebook_likes\n Min.   :  1.0          Min.   :  7.0   Min.   :    0.0        \n 1st Qu.: 50.0          1st Qu.: 93.0   1st Qu.:    7.0        \n Median :110.0          Median :103.0   Median :   49.0        \n Mean   :140.2          Mean   :107.2   Mean   :  686.5        \n 3rd Qu.:195.0          3rd Qu.:118.0   3rd Qu.:  194.5        \n Max.   :813.0          Max.   :511.0   Max.   :23000.0        \n NA's   :50             NA's   :15      NA's   :104            \n actor_3_facebook_likes          actor_2_name  actor_1_facebook_likes\n Min.   :    0.0        Morgan Freeman :  20   Min.   :     0        \n 1st Qu.:  133.0        Charlize Theron:  15   1st Qu.:   614        \n Median :  371.5        Brad Pitt      :  14   Median :   988        \n Mean   :  645.0        James Franco   :  11   Mean   :  6560        \n 3rd Qu.:  636.0        Meryl Streep   :  11   3rd Qu.: 11000        \n Max.   :23000.0        (Other)        :4959   Max.   :640000        \n NA's   :23             NA's           :  13   NA's   :7             \n     gross                            genres             actor_1_name \n Min.   :      162   Drama               : 236   Robert De Niro:  49  \n 1st Qu.:  5340988   Comedy              : 209   Johnny Depp   :  41  \n Median : 25517500   Comedy|Drama        : 191   Nicolas Cage  :  33  \n Mean   : 48468408   Comedy|Drama|Romance: 187   J.K.

The minimum, maximum, median, and 1st and third quartiles\nWhat type of info is provided on categorical variables? How many times a given value shows up\nWhat stands out to you in these summaries? Is there anything you’d need to clean before using this data? There seems to be a lot of repeats on categorical variables, certainly on color (which is inconsistent) but also possibly on things like movie_title, although they may be movies with the same title rather than duplicate entries. In quantitative variables, there are a lot of NAs, and a good few in the categorical variables too, which is fine, we just would have to figure out what they mean and if we need to remove them are rename them depending on the column and what data we want to analyze\nExercise 4: Clean Data: Factor Variables 1\nIf you didn’t already in Exercise 3, check out the color variable in the imdb_messy dataset.\n\nWhat’s goofy about this / what do we need to fix? There are 3 names for Color movies, 2 for Black and White movies, and it is unclear what NA means\nMore specifically, what different categories does the color variable take, and how many movies fall into each of these categories? There are roughly 4800 movies that are in color (with the value either being “Color”,“COLOR”,or “color”), about 210 movies in black and white (with a value of either “B&W” or “Black and White”), and 19 movies for which color is Not Applicable, which is immediately apparent as to meaning\nExercise 5: Clean Data: Factor Variables 2\nWhen working with categorical variables like color, the categories must be “clean”, i.e. consistent and in the correct format. Let’s make that happen.\nPart a\nWe could open the .csv file in, say, Excel or Google sheets, clean up the color variable, save a clean copy, and then reimport that into RStudio. BUT that would be the wrong thing to do. Why is it important to use R code, which we then save inside this qmd, to clean our data?\nIt’s much faster, and it is clearly reproducible from the starting point of the publically available data\nPart b\nLet’s use R code to change the color variable so that it appropriately combines the various categories into only 2: Color and Black_White. We’ve learned a couple sets of string-related tools that could be handy here. First, starting with the imdb_messy data, change the color variable using one of the functions we learned in the Factors lesson.\nfct_relevel(), fct_recode(), fct_reorder()\nStore your results in imdb_temp (don’t overwrite imdb_messy). To check your work, print out a count() table of the color variable in imdb_temp.\n\nimdb_temp &lt;- imdb_messy |&gt;\n  mutate(color=\n    fct_recode(color, \n               Color=\"COLOR\",

This is encoded as NA (not available) in R. There are a few questions to address about missing data:\n\n\nHow many values are missing data? What’s the volume of the missingness?\n\nWhy are some values missing?\n\nWhat should we do about the missing values?\n\nLet’s consider the first 2 questions in this exercise.\nPart a\nAs a first step, let’s simply understand the volume of NAs. Specifically:\n\n# Count the total number of rows in imdb_messy\nnrow(imdb_messy)\n\n[1] 5043\n\n# Then count the number of NAs in each column\ncolSums(is.na(imdb_messy))\n\n                     ...1                     color             director_name \n                        0                        19                       104 \n   num_critic_for_reviews                  duration   director_facebook_likes \n                       50                        15                       104 \n   actor_3_facebook_likes              actor_2_name    actor_1_facebook_likes \n                       23                        13                         7 \n                    gross                    genres              actor_1_name \n                      884                         0                         7 \n              movie_title           num_voted_users cast_total_facebook_likes \n                        0                         0                         0 \n             actor_3_name      facenumber_in_poster             plot_keywords \n                       23                        13                       153 \n          movie_imdb_link      num_user_for_reviews                  language \n                        0                        21                        12 \n                  country            content_rating                    budget \n                        5                       303                       492 \n               title_year    actor_2_facebook_likes                imdb_score \n                      108                        13                         0 \n             aspect_ratio      movie_facebook_likes \n                      329                         0 \n\n# Then count the number of NAs in a specific column\nimdb_messy |&gt; \n  summarize(sum(is.na(actor_1_facebook_likes)))\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 1\n  `sum(is.na(actor_1_facebook_likes))`\n                                 &lt;int&gt;\n1                                    7\n\n\nPart b\nAs a second step, let’s think about why some values are missing. Study the individual observations with NAs carefully. Why do you think they are missing? Are certain films more likely to have more NAs than others? Associated values will be missing when something is absent, eg, when actor_3_name is NA, so is actor_3_facebook_likes. This might mean that in these cases, there literally aren’t 3rd actors in these films. Its not immediately clear which films are more likely to have NAs, but one example near the top is Doug Walker’s review of Star Wars the Force Awakens, which is officially a documentary, but is really a youtube video, and lacks lots of variables, both answerable (color, language) and less-so (gross, budget)\nPart c\nConsider a more specific example. Obtain a dataset of movies that are missing data on actor_1_facebook_likes. Then explain why you think there are NAs. HINT: is.na(___) All 7 of these documentaries have no actors listed, presumably consisting mostly of archival footage, and therefore have no actor facebooks to pull likes from.\n\nimdb_messy |&gt;\n  filter(is.na(actor_1_facebook_likes)==TRUE)\n\n# A tibble: 7 × 29\n   ...1 color director_name     num_critic_for_reviews duration\n  &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt;                              &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;\n1  4503 Color Léa Pool                              23       97\n2  4520 Color Harry Gantz                           12      105\n3  4721 Color U.

There is no perfect or universal approach here. Rather, we must think carefully about…\n\nWhy the values are missing?\nWhat we want to do with our data?\nWhat is the impact of removing or replacing missing data on our work / conclusions?\n\nPart a\nCalculate the average duration of a film. THINK: How can we deal with the NA’s?\nFollow-up:\nHow are the NAs dealt with here? Did we have to create and save a new dataset in order to do this analysis?\nPart b\nTry out the drop_na() function:\n\n imdb_temp &lt;- drop_na(imdb_messy)\nhead(imdb_temp)\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 29\n   ...1 color director_name     num_critic_for_reviews duration\n  &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt;                              &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;\n1     1 Color James Cameron                        723      178\n2     2 Color Gore Verbinski                       302      169\n3     3 Color Sam Mendes                           602      148\n4     4 Color Christopher Nolan                    813      164\n5     6 Color Andrew Stanton                       462      132\n6     7 Color Sam Raimi                            392      156\n# ℹ 24 more variables: director_facebook_likes &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   actor_3_facebook_likes &lt;dbl&gt;, actor_2_name &lt;chr&gt;,\n#   actor_1_facebook_likes &lt;dbl&gt;, gross &lt;dbl&gt;, genres &lt;chr&gt;,\n#   actor_1_name &lt;chr&gt;, movie_title &lt;chr&gt;, num_voted_users &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   cast_total_facebook_likes &lt;dbl&gt;, actor_3_name &lt;chr&gt;,\n#   facenumber_in_poster &lt;dbl&gt;, plot_keywords &lt;chr&gt;, movie_imdb_link &lt;chr&gt;,\n#   num_user_for_reviews &lt;dbl&gt;, language &lt;chr&gt;, country &lt;chr&gt;, …\n\n\nFollow-up questions:\n\nWhat did drop_na() do? How many data points are left?\nIn what situations might this function be a good idea?\nIn what situations might this function be a bad idea?\nPart c\ndrop_na() removes data points that have any NA values, even if we don’t care about the variable(s) for which data is missing. This can result in losing a lot of data points that do have data on the variables we actually care about! For example, suppose we only want to explore the relationship between film duration and whether it’s in color. Check out a plot:\n\n# ggplot(imdb_messy, aes(x = duration, fill = color)) + \n#   geom_density()\n\nFollow-up:\n\nCreate a new dataset with only and all movies that have complete info on duration and color. HINT: You could use !is.na(___) or drop_na() (differently than above)\nUse this new dataset to create a new and improved plot.\nHow many movies remain in your new dataset? Hence why this is better than using the dataset from part b?\nPart d\nIn some cases, missing data is more non-data than unknown data. For example, the films with NAs for actor_1_facebook_likes actually have 0 Facebook likes–they don’t even have actors! In these cases, we can replace the NAs with a 0. Use the replace_na() function to create a new dataset (imdb_temp) that replaces the NAs in actor_1_facebook_likes with 0. You’ll have to check out the help file for this function.\nExercise 8: New Data + Projects\nLet’s practice the above ideas while also planting some seeds for the course project. Each group will pick and analyze their own dataset. The people you’re sitting with today aren’t necessarily your project groups! BUT do some brainstorming together:\n\nShare with each other: What are some personal hobbies or passions or things you’ve been thinking about or things you’d like to learn more about? Don’t think too hard about this! Just share what’s at the top of mind today.\nEach individual: Find a dataset online that’s related to one of the topics you shared in the above prompt.\nDiscuss what data you found with your group!\nLoad the data into RStudio, perform some basic checks, and perform some preliminary cleaning, as necessary.",

Yes, we lost a bunch! We lost all sorts of data on islands, flipper and bill size, and the year of obvservation, along with the specifics of each penguin, and any data on penguins with NA for any of their values ## Reshaping Data\n\nThere are two general types of reshaped data:\n\naggregate data\nFor example, using group_by() with summarize() gains aggregate information about our observations but loses data on individual observations.\nraw data, reshaped\nWe often want to retain all information on individual observations, but need to reshape it in order to perform the task at hand.\nExample 4: reshape it with your mind\nLet’s calculate the difference in average body mass, male vs female, for each species. Since penguin_avg is small, we could do these calculations by hand. But this doesn’t scale up to bigger datasets.\n\nSketch out (on paper, in your head, anything) how this data would need to be reshaped, without losing any information, in order to calculate the differences in average body mass using our wrangling verbs. Make it as specific as possible, with column labels, entries, correct numbers, etc. We could have individual columns for male and female body mass, which we could then mutate to find the difference\nIdentify the units of observation. Species on whole\n\n\npenguin_avg\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 3\n# Groups:   species [3]\n  species   sex    avg_body_mass\n  &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;chr&gt;          &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 Adelie    female         3369.\n2 Adelie    male           4043.\n3 Chinstrap female         3527.\n4 Chinstrap male           3939.\n5 Gentoo    female         4680.\n6 Gentoo    male           5485.\n\n\nWider vs Longer formats\nMaking our data longer or wider reshapes the data, changing the units of observation while retaining all raw information:\n\nMake the data longer, i.e. combine values from multiple variables into 1 variable. Example: 1999 and 2000 represent two years. We want to combine their results into 1 variable without losing any information.\n\n\n\nMake the data wider, i.e. spread out the values across new variables. Example: cases and pop represent two categories within type. To compare or combine their count outcomes side-by-side, we can separate them into their own variables.\n\n\nExample 5: pivot wider\nBecause it’s a small enough dataset to examine all at once, let’s start with our penguin_avg data:\n\npenguin_avg\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 3\n# Groups:   species [3]\n  species   sex    avg_body_mass\n  &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;chr&gt;          &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 Adelie    female         3369.\n2 Adelie    male           4043.\n3 Chinstrap female         3527.\n4 Chinstrap male           3939.\n5 Gentoo    female         4680.\n6 Gentoo    male           5485.\n\n\nWith the goal of being able to calculate the difference in average body mass, male vs female, for each species, let’s make the dataset wider. That is, let’s get one row per species with separate columns for the average body mass by sex. Put this code into a chunk and run it:\n\npenguin_avg |&gt; \npivot_wider(names_from = sex, values_from = avg_body_mass)\n\n# A tibble: 3 × 3\n# Groups:   species [3]\n  species   female  male\n  &lt;chr&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 Adelie     3369. 4043.\n2 Chinstrap  3527. 3939.\n3 Gentoo     4680. 5485.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPivot Wider\n\n\n\n\n\nnames_from = the variable whose values we want to separate into their own columns, i.e. where we want to get the new column names from\n\n\nvalues_from = which variable to take the new column values from\n\n\n\n\nFOLLOW-UP:\n\nWhat are the units of observation? The species on whole\nDid we lose any information when we widened the data? Nope!\nUse the wide data to calculate the difference in average body mass, male vs female, for each species.\n\n\npenguin_avg |&gt; \npivot_wider(names_from = sex, values_from = avg_body_mass) |&gt;\n  mutate(body_mass_diff=(male-female))\n\n# A tibble: 3 × 4\n# Groups:   species [3]\n  species   female  male body_mass_diff\n  &lt;chr&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;          &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 Adelie     3369. 4043.           675.\n2 Chinstrap  3527. 3939.           412.\n3 Gentoo     4680. 5485.           805.\n\n\nExample 6: Pivot longer\nLet’s store our wide data:\n\npenguin_avg_wide &lt;- penguin_avg |&gt; \n  pivot_wider(names_from = sex, values_from = avg_body_mass)\n\npenguin_avg_wide\n\n# A tibble: 3 × 3\n# Groups:   species [3]\n  species   female  male\n  &lt;chr&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 Adelie     3369. 4043.\n2 Chinstrap  3527. 3939.\n3 Gentoo     4680. 5485.\n\n\nSuppose we wanted to change this data back to a longer format. In general, this happens when some variables (here female and male) represent two categories or values of some broader variable (here sex), and we want to combine them into that 1 variable without losing any information. Let’s pivot_longer():\n\n# We can either communicate which variables we WANT to collect into a single column (female, male)\npenguin_avg_wide |&gt; \n  pivot_longer(cols = c(female, male), names_to = \"sex\", values_to = \"avg_body_mass\")\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 3\n# Groups:   species [3]\n  species   sex    avg_body_mass\n  &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;chr&gt;          &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 Adelie    female         3369.\n2 Adelie    male           4043.\n3 Chinstrap female         3527.\n4 Chinstrap male           3939.\n5 Gentoo    female         4680.\n6 Gentoo    male           5485.\n\n# Or which variable(s) we do NOT want to collect into a single column (sex)\npenguin_avg_wide |&gt; \n  pivot_longer(cols = -species, names_to = \"sex\", values_to = \"avg_body_mass\")\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 3\n# Groups:   species [3]\n  species   sex    avg_body_mass\n  &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;chr&gt;          &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 Adelie    female         3369.\n2 Adelie    male           4043.\n3 Chinstrap female         3527.\n4 Chinstrap male           3939.\n5 Gentoo    female         4680.\n6 Gentoo    male           5485.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPivot Longer\n\n\n\n\n\ncols = the columns (variables) to collect into a single, new variable. We can also specify what variables we don’t want to collect\n\nnames_to = the name of the new variable which will include the names or labels of the collected variables\n\nvalues_to = the name of the new variable which will include the values of the collected variables\n\n\n\nFOLLOW-UP:\n\nWhat are the units of observation? Male/female populations of each species\nDid we lose any information when we lengthened the data? Nope!\nWhy did we put the variables in quotes “” here but not when we used pivot_wider()? Because the sex and avg_body mass columns no longer exist, so we are defining their names, rather than calling an object\nExample 7: Practice\nLet’s make up some data on the orders of 2 different customers at 3 different restaurants:\n\nfood &lt;- data.frame(\n  customer = rep(c(\"A\", \"B\"), each = 3),\n  restaurant = rep(c(\"Shish\", \"FrenchMeadow\", \"DunnBros\"), 2),\n  order = c(\"falafel\", \"salad\", \"coffee\", \"baklava\", \"pastry\", \"tea\")\n)\nfood\n\n  customer   restaurant   order\n1        A        Shish falafel\n2        A FrenchMeadow   salad\n3        A     DunnBros  coffee\n4        B        Shish baklava\n5        B FrenchMeadow  pastry\n6        B     DunnBros     tea\n\n\nThe units of observation in food are customer / restaurant combinations. Wrangle this data so that the units of observation are customers, spreading the restaurants into separate columns.\n\nfood |&gt;\n  pivot_wider(names_from = restaurant,values_from = order)\n\n# A tibble: 2 × 4\n  customer Shish   FrenchMeadow DunnBros\n  &lt;chr&gt;    &lt;chr&gt;   &lt;chr&gt;        &lt;chr&gt;   \n1 A        falafel salad        coffee  \n2 B        baklava pastry       tea     \n\n\nConsider 2 more customers:\n\nmore_food &lt;- data.frame(\n  customer = c(\"C\", \"D\"),\n  Shish = c(\"coffee\", \"maza\"),\n  FrenchMeadow = c(\"soup\", \"sandwich\"),\n  DunnBros = c(\"cookie\", \"coffee\")\n)\nmore_food\n\n  customer  Shish FrenchMeadow DunnBros\n1        C coffee         soup   cookie\n2        D   maza     sandwich   coffee\n\n\nWrangle this data so that the 3 restaurant columns are combined into 1, hence the units of observation are customer / restaurant combinations.\n\nmore_food |&gt;\n  pivot_longer(cols = -customer, names_to = \"Restaurant\", values_to = \"Order\")\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 3\n  customer Restaurant   Order   \n  &lt;chr&gt;    &lt;chr&gt;        &lt;chr&gt;   \n1 C        Shish        coffee  \n2 C        FrenchMeadow soup    \n3 C        DunnBros     cookie  \n4 D        Shish        maza    \n5 D        FrenchMeadow sandwich\n6 D        DunnBros     coffee",

Test Subjects\nPart b\nSuppose I ask you to plot each subject’s reaction time (y-axis) vs the number of days of sleep restriction (x-axis). “Sketch” out in words what the first few rows of the data need to look like in order to do this. It might help to think about what you’d need to complete the plotting frame:\nYou would want to have each day as its own row, with each subject having one for each of th 9 days. the reaction times would end up in another column. it might look something like\nsubject day react_ms 308 0 249.56 308 1 258.70\nggplot(sleep_long, aes(y = react_ms, x = day, color = Subject))\nPart c\nHow can you obtain the dataset you sketched in part b?\n\njust using sleep_wide\n\npivot_longer()\npivot_wider()\n\npivot_longer() would probably be best!\nExercise 2: Pivot longer\nTo plot reaction time by day for each subject, we need to reshape the data into a long format where each row represents a subject/day combination.

It removed the “day” from the start of the values in the day coloumn (which was originally part of their object label)\nHow did this impact how the values are recorded in the day column? It made them into integers, although they are still class chr #### Part c {.unnumbered}\n\nUsing sleep_long, construct a line plot of reaction time vs day for each subject. This will look goofy no matter what you do. Why? HINT: look back at head(sleep_long). What class or type of variables are Subject and day? Subject is an integer (Why? Like in the first place…) and day is a character string What do we want them to be?

Take note of the mutate() code! You’ll use this type of code a lot.\n\nsleep_long &lt;- sleep_wide |&gt;\n  pivot_longer(cols = -Subject,\n               names_to = \"day\",\n               names_prefix = \"day_\",\n               values_to = \"reaction_time\") |&gt; \n  mutate(Subject = as.factor(Subject), day = as.numeric(day))\n\n# Check it out\n# Same data, different class\nhead(sleep_long)\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 3\n  Subject   day reaction_time\n  &lt;fct&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;         &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 308         0          250.\n2 308         1          259.\n3 308         2          251.\n4 308         3          321.\n5 308         4          357.\n6 308         5          415.\n\n\nPart a\nNow make some plots.\n\n# Make a line plot of reaction time by day for each subject\n# Put these all on the same frame\nggplot(sleep_long, aes(x=day,y=reaction_time,color=Subject)) +\n  geom_line()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Make a line plot of reaction time by day for each subject\n# Put these all on separate frames (one per subject)\nggplot(sleep_long, aes(x=day,y=reaction_time)) +\n  geom_line() +\n  facet_wrap(~ Subject)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPart b\nSummarize what you learned from the plots. For example:\n\nWhat’s the general relationship between reaction time and sleep? Reaction time increases (that is, gets longer) as days of sleeping 3 hours increase\nIs this the same for everybody? What differs? Nope! Some had major outliers of both faster and slower reaction time, of course, but the general trends also differed between subjects. Some had a delayed response, and some people weren’t significantly affected. for Subject 335, their reaction time actually got better\n\nExercise 4: Pivot wider\nMake the data wide again, with each day becoming its own column.\nPart a\nAdjust the code below.

And get rid of any rows missing information on broad_group. You’ll learn the code soon! For now, just run this chunk:\n\nplot_data &lt;- daily |&gt; \n  mutate(broad_group = case_when(\n    group %in% c(\"Acting\", \"Athletics\", \"Comedy\", \"Musician\") ~ \"Acting, Comedy & Music\",\n    group %in% c(\"Media\", \"media\", \"Science\", \"Academic\", \"Consultant\", \"Clergy\") ~ \"Media\",\n    group %in% c(\"Politician\", \"Political Aide\", \"Government\", \"Military\", \"Business\", \"Advocacy\") ~ \"Government and Politics\",\n    .default = NA\n  )) |&gt; \n  filter(!is.na(broad_group))\n\nNow, using the broad_group variable in plot_data, recreate the graphic from the article, with three different lines showing the fraction of guests in each group over time. Note: You’ll have to wrangle the data first.\n\nplot_data |&gt;\n  group_by(year,broad_group) |&gt;\n  summarize(appearances=n()) |&gt;\n  mutate(percent_app=appearances/sum(appearances)) |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x=year,y=percent_app,color=broad_group)) +\n  geom_line()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#FLAG",

Filtering joins keep only certain observations in one dataset (like filter()), not based on rules related to any variables in the dataset, but on the observations that exist in another dataset.

You get an error! Identify the problem by reviewing the error message and the datasets we’re trying to join. The key variables are different names! course and class\n\n eval = FALSE: #don't evaluate this chunk when knitting. it produces an error.\nstudents_2 |&gt; \n  left_join(enrollments_2)\n\nPart b\nThe problem is that course name, the key or variable that links these two datasets, is labeled differently: class in the students_2 data and course in the enrollments_2 data. Thus we have to specify these keys in our code:\n\nstudents_2 |&gt; \n  left_join(enrollments_2, join_by(class == course))\n\n  student    class enrollment\n1       D COMP 101         19\n2       E BIOL 101         20\n3       F POLI 101         NA\n\n\n\n# The order of the keys is important:\n# join_by(\"left data key\" == \"right data key\")\n# The order is mixed up here, thus we get an error:\nstudents_2 |&gt; \n  left_join(enrollments_2, join_by(course == class))\n\nPart c\nDefine another set of fake data which adds grade information:\n\n# Add student grades in each course\nstudents_3 &lt;- data.frame(\n  student = c(\"Y\", \"Y\", \"Z\", \"Z\"),\n  class = c(\"COMP 101\", \"BIOL 101\", \"POLI 101\", \"COMP 101\"),\n  grade = c(\"B\", \"S\", \"C\", \"A\")\n)\n\n# Check it out\nstudents_3\n\n  student    class grade\n1       Y COMP 101     B\n2       Y BIOL 101     S\n3       Z POLI 101     C\n4       Z COMP 101     A\n\n# Add average grades in each course\nenrollments_3 &lt;- data.frame(\n  class = c(\"ART 101\", \"BIOL 101\",\"COMP 101\"),\n  grade = c(\"B\", \"A\", \"A-\"),\n  enrollment = c(20, 18, 19)\n)\n\n# Check it out\nenrollments_3\n\n     class grade enrollment\n1  ART 101     B         20\n2 BIOL 101     A         18\n3 COMP 101    A-         19\n\n\nTry doing a left_join() to link the students’ classes to their enrollment info.

BUT grade is measuring 2 different things here: individual student grades in students_3 and average student grades in enrollments_3. Thus it doesn’t make sense to try to join the datasets with respect to this variable. We can again solve this by specifying that we want to join the datasets using the class variable as a key. What are grade.x and grade.y? grade.x is the value of grade from the left dataframe, and grade.y is the value of grade from the right dataframe\n\nstudents_3 |&gt; \n  left_join(enrollments_3, join_by(class == class))\n\n  student    class grade.x grade.y enrollment\n1       Y COMP 101       B      A-         19\n2       Y BIOL 101       S       A         18\n3       Z POLI 101       C    &lt;NA&gt;         NA\n4       Z COMP 101       A      A-         19\n\n\nExercise 2: More small practice\nBefore applying these ideas to bigger datasets, let’s practice identifying which join is appropriate in different scenarios. Define the following fake data on voters (people who have voted) and contact info for voting age adults (people who could vote):\n\n# People who have voted\nvoters &lt;- data.frame(\n  id = c(\"A\", \"D\", \"E\", \"F\", \"G\"),\n  times_voted = c(2, 4, 17, 6, 20)\n)\n\nvoters\n\n  id times_voted\n1  A           2\n2  D           4\n3  E          17\n4  F           6\n5  G          20\n\n# Contact info for voting age adults\ncontact &lt;- data.frame(\n  name = c(\"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\"),\n  address = c(\"summit\", \"grand\", \"snelling\", \"fairview\"),\n  age = c(24, 89, 43, 38)\n)\n\ncontact\n\n  name  address age\n1    A   summit  24\n2    B    grand  89\n3    C snelling  43\n4    D fairview  38\n\n\nUse the appropriate join for each prompt below. In each case, think before you type:\n\nWhat dataset goes on the left?\nWhat do you want the resulting dataset to look like? How many rows and columns will it have?\n\n\n# 1. We want contact info for people who HAVEN'T voted\ncontact |&gt;\n  anti_join(voters, join_by(name==id))\n\n  name  address age\n1    B    grand  89\n2    C snelling  43\n\n# 2.

In grades, each row is a student-class pair with information on:\n\n\nsid = student ID\n\ngrade = student’s grade\n\nsessionID = an identifier of the class section\n\n\n# Get rid of some duplicate rows!\ngrades &lt;- read.csv(\"https://mac-stat.github.io/data/grades.csv\") |&gt; \n  distinct(sid, sessionID, .keep_all = TRUE)\nhead(grades)\n\n     sid grade   sessionID\n1 S31185    D+ session1784\n2 S31185    B+ session1785\n3 S31185    A- session1791\n4 S31185    B+ session1792\n5 S31185    B- session1794\n6 S31185    C+ session1795\n\n\nIn courses, each row corresponds to a class section with information on:\n\n\nsessionID = an identifier of the class section\n\ndept = department\n\nlevel = course level (eg: 100)\n\nsem = semester\n\nenroll = enrollment (number of students)\n\niid = instructor ID\n\n\n\n    sessionID dept level    sem enroll     iid\n1 session1784    M   100 FA1991     22 inst265\n2 session1785    k   100 FA1991     52 inst458\n3 session1791    J   100 FA1993     22 inst223\n4 session1792    J   300 FA1993     20 inst235\n5 session1794    J   200 FA1993     22 inst234\n6 session1795    J   200 SP1994     26 inst230\n\n\nUse R code to take a quick glance at the data.\n\n# How many observations (rows) and variables (columns) are there in the grades data?\nstr(grades)\n\n'data.frame':   5844 obs. of  3 variables:\n $ sid      : chr  \"S31185\" \"S31185\" \"S31185\" \"S31185\" ...\n $ grade    : chr  \"D+\" \"B+\" \"A-\" \"B+\" ...\n $ sessionID: chr  \"session1784\" \"session1785\" \"session1791\" \"session1792\" ...\n\n# 5844 rows, 3 columns\n\n# How many observations (rows) and variables (columns) are there in the courses data?\nstr(courses)\n\n'data.frame':   1718 obs. of  6 variables:\n $ sessionID: chr  \"session1784\" \"session1785\" \"session1791\" \"session1792\" ...\n $ dept     : chr  \"M\" \"k\" \"J\" \"J\" ...\n $ level    : int  100 100 100 300 200 200 200 100 300 100 ...\n $ sem      : chr  \"FA1991\" \"FA1991\" \"FA1993\" \"FA1993\" ...\n $ enroll   : int  22 52 22 20 22 26 25 38 16 43 ...\n $ iid      : chr  \"inst265\" \"inst458\" \"inst223\" \"inst235\" ...\n\n# 1718 rows, 6 columns\n\nExercise 4: Class size\nHow big are the classes?\nPart a\nBefore digging in, note that some courses are listed twice in the courses data:\n\ncourses |&gt; \n  count(sessionID) |&gt; \n  filter(n &gt; 1)\n\n     sessionID n\n1  session2047 2\n2  session2067 2\n3  session2448 2\n4  session2509 2\n5  session2541 2\n6  session2824 2\n7  session2826 2\n8  session2862 2\n9  session2897 2\n10 session3046 2\n11 session3057 2\n12 session3123 2\n13 session3243 2\n14 session3257 2\n15 session3387 2\n16 session3400 2\n17 session3414 2\n18 session3430 2\n19 session3489 2\n20 session3524 2\n21 session3629 2\n22 session3643 2\n23 session3821 2\n\n\nIf we pick out just 1 of these, we learn that some courses are cross-listed in multiple departments:\n\ncourses |&gt; \n  filter(sessionID == \"session2047\")\n\n    sessionID dept level    sem enroll     iid\n1 session2047    g   100 FA2001     12 inst436\n2 session2047    m   100 FA2001     28 inst436\n\n\nFor our class size exploration, obtain the total enrollments in each sessionID, combining any cross-listed sections. Save this as courses_combined. NOTE: There’s no joining to do here!\n\ncourses_combined &lt;- courses |&gt;\n  group_by(sessionID) |&gt;\n  summarize(enroll = sum(enroll))\n\n# Check that this has 1695 rows and 2 columns\ndim(courses_combined)\n\n[1] 1695    2\n\n\nPart b\nLet’s first examine the question of class size from the administration’s viewpoint. To this end, calculate the median class size across all class sections. (The median is the middle or 50th percentile. Unlike the mean, it’s not skewed by outliers.) THINK FIRST:\n\nWhich of the 2 datasets do you need to answer this question? One? Both? I think I just need course_combined…\nIf you need course information, use courses_combined not courses.\nDo you have to do any joining? If so, which dataset will go on the left, i.e. which dataset includes your primary observations of interest? Which join function will you need? Shouldn’t have to!\n\n\ncourses_combined |&gt;\n  summarize(median(enroll))\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 1\n  `median(enroll)`\n             &lt;int&gt;\n1               18\n\n#or just\nmedian(courses_combined$enroll)\n\n[1] 18\n\n\nPart c\nBut how big are classes from the student perspective? To this end, calculate the median class size for each individual student. Once you have the correct output, store it as student_class_size. THINK FIRST:\n\nWhich of the 2 datasets do you need to answer this question? One? Both? I will definitely need both\nIf you need course information, use courses_combined not courses.\nDo you have to do any joining? If so, which dataset will go on the left, i.e. which dataset includes your primary observations of interest? Which join function will you need? grades ought to go on the left, since its per student!\n\n\nstudent_class_size &lt;- grades |&gt;\n  left_join(courses_combined) |&gt;\n    group_by(sid) |&gt;\n    summarize(med_size = median(enroll))\nstudent_class_size\n\n# A tibble: 443 × 2\n   sid    med_size\n   &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1 S31185     23.5\n 2 S31188     21  \n 3 S31191     25  \n 4 S31194     15  \n 5 S31197     24  \n 6 S31200     21  \n 7 S31203     20  \n 8 S31206     17  \n 9 S31209     20  \n10 S31212     21  \n# ℹ 433 more rows\n\n\nPart d\nThe median class size varies from student to student. To get a sense for the typical student experience and range in student experiences, construct and discuss a histogram of the median class sizes experienced by the students.\nThe most common median class size by a good deal is right around 20, but generally the range between 18 and 24 is fairly typical. Although in fewer numbers, that is small chunk of students with media class sizes between 25 and 30, descending as we approach 30. Median class sizes past 30 are rare, with only about 1-3 students for each value, the maximum being 1 student with a median class size of 38. On the lower side, there a good few students who have median class sizes between 16 and 17, but frequency drops off steeply below that, with only 2 students at the minimum, having median class sizes of 12.\n\n ggplot(student_class_size, aes(x = med_size)) + \n   geom_histogram(color=\"black\",fill=\"coral2\", binwidth=1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 5: Narrowing in on classes\nPart a\nShow data on the students that enrolled in session1986.

    "text": "16.2 Factors\nIn the remaining days of our data preparation unit, we’ll focus on working with special types of “categorical” variables: characters and factors. Variables with these structures often require special tools and considerations.\nWe’ll focus on two common considerations:\n\n\nRegular expressions\nWhen working with character strings, we might want to detect, replace, or extract certain patterns. For example, recall our data on courses:\n\n\n\n    sessionID dept level    sem enroll     iid\n1 session1784    M   100 FA1991     22 inst265\n2 session1785    k   100 FA1991     52 inst458\n3 session1791    J   100 FA1993     22 inst223\n4 session1792    J   300 FA1993     20 inst235\n5 session1794    J   200 FA1993     22 inst234\n6 session1795    J   200 SP1994     26 inst230\n\n\n'data.frame':   1718 obs. of  6 variables:\n $ sessionID: chr  \"session1784\" \"session1785\" \"session1791\" \"session1792\" ...\n $ dept     : chr  \"M\" \"k\" \"J\" \"J\" ...\n $ level    : int  100 100 100 300 200 200 200 100 300 100 ...\n $ sem      : chr  \"FA1991\" \"FA1991\" \"FA1993\" \"FA1993\" ...\n $ enroll   : int  22 52 22 20 22 26 25 38 16 43 ...\n $ iid      : chr  \"inst265\" \"inst458\" \"inst223\" \"inst235\" ...\n\n\nFocusing on just the sem character variable, we might want to…\n\nchange FA to fall_ and SP to spring_\n\nkeep only courses taught in fall\nsplit the variable into 2 new variables: semester (FA or SP) and year\n\n\n\n\nConverting characters to factors (and factors to meaningful factors) (today)\nWhen categorical information is stored as a character variable, the categories of interest might not be labeled or ordered in a meaningful way. We can fix that!\n\nExample 1: Default Order\nRecall our data on presidential election outcomes in each U.S. county (except those in Alaska):\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nelections &lt;- read.csv(\"https://mac-stat.github.io/data/election_2020_county.csv\") |&gt; \n  select(state_abbr, historical, county_name, total_votes_20, repub_pct_20, dem_pct_20) |&gt; \n  mutate(dem_support_20 = case_when(\n    (repub_pct_20 - dem_pct_20 &gt;= 5) ~ \"low\",\n    (repub_pct_20 - dem_pct_20 &lt;= -5) ~ \"high\",\n    .default = \"medium\"\n  ))\n\n# Check it out\nhead(elections)  \n\n  state_abbr historical    county_name total_votes_20 repub_pct_20 dem_pct_20\n1         AL        red Autauga County          27770        71.44      27.02\n2         AL        red Baldwin County         109679        76.17      22.41\n3         AL        red Barbour County          10518        53.45      45.79\n4         AL        red    Bibb County           9595        78.43      20.70\n5         AL        red  Blount County          27588        89.57       9.57\n6         AL        red Bullock County           4613        24.84      74.70\n  dem_support_20\n1            low\n2            low\n3            low\n4            low\n5            low\n6           high\n\n\nCheck out the below visual and numerical summaries of dem_support_20:\n\nlow = the Republican won the county by at least 5 percentage points\nmedium = the Republican and Democrat votes were within 5 percentage points\nhigh = the Democrat won the county by at least 5 percentage points\n\n\nggplot(elections, aes(x = dem_support_20)) + \n  geom_bar()\n\n\n\n\n\n\nelections |&gt; \n  count(dem_support_20)\n\n  dem_support_20    n\n1           high  458\n2            low 2494\n3         medium  157\n\n\nFollow-up:\nWhat don’t you like about these results?\nThey’re out of order: it goes high, then low, then medium, which doesn’t really make sense\nExample 2: Change Order using fct_relevel\n\nThe above categories of dem_support_20 are listed alphabetically, which isn’t particularly meaningful here. This is because dem_support_20 is a character variable and R thinks of character strings as words, not category labels with any meaningful order (other than alphabetical):\n\nstr(elections)\n\n'data.frame':   3109 obs. of  7 variables:\n $ state_abbr    : chr  \"AL\" \"AL\" \"AL\" \"AL\" ...\n $ historical    : chr  \"red\" \"red\" \"red\" \"red\" ...\n $ county_name   : chr  \"Autauga County\" \"Baldwin County\" \"Barbour County\" \"Bibb County\" ...\n $ total_votes_20: int  27770 109679 10518 9595 27588 4613 9488 50983 15284 12301 ...\n $ repub_pct_20  : num  71.4 76.2 53.5 78.4 89.6 ...\n $ dem_pct_20    : num  27.02 22.41 45.79 20.7 9.57 ...\n $ dem_support_20: chr  \"low\" \"low\" \"low\" \"low\" ...\n\n\nWe can fix this by using fct_relevel() to both:\n\nStore dem_support_20 as a factor variable, the levels of which are recognized as specific levels or categories, not just words.\nSpecify a meaningful order for the levels of the factor variable.\n\n\n# Notice that the order of the levels is not alphabetical!\nelections &lt;- elections |&gt; \n  mutate(dem_support_20 = fct_relevel(dem_support_20, c(\"low\", \"medium\", \"high\")))\n\n# Notice the new structure of the dem_support_20 variable\nstr(elections)\n\n'data.frame':   3109 obs. of  7 variables:\n $ state_abbr    : chr  \"AL\" \"AL\" \"AL\" \"AL\" ...\n $ historical    : chr  \"red\" \"red\" \"red\" \"red\" ...\n $ county_name   : chr  \"Autauga County\" \"Baldwin County\" \"Barbour County\" \"Bibb County\" ...\n $ total_votes_20: int  27770 109679 10518 9595 27588 4613 9488 50983 15284 12301 ...\n $ repub_pct_20  : num  71.4 76.2 53.5 78.4 89.6 ...\n $ dem_pct_20    : num  27.02 22.41 45.79 20.7 9.57 ...\n $ dem_support_20: Factor w/ 3 levels \"low\",\"medium\",..: 1 1 1 1 1 3 1 1 1 1 ...\n\n\n\n# And plot dem_support_20\nggplot(elections, aes(x = dem_support_20)) +\n  geom_bar()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 3: Change Labels using fct_recode\n\nWe now have a factor variable, dem_support_20, with categories that are ordered in a meaningful way:\n\nelections |&gt; \n  count(dem_support_20)\n\n  dem_support_20    n\n1            low 2494\n2         medium  157\n3           high  458\n\n\nBut maybe we want to change up the category labels. For demo purposes, let’s create a new factor variable, results_20, that’s the same as dem_support_20 but with different category labels:\n\n# We can redefine any number of the category labels.\n# Here we'll relabel all 3 categories:\nelections &lt;- elections |&gt; \n  mutate(results_20 = fct_recode(dem_support_20, \n                                 \"strong republican\" = \"low\",\n                                 \"close race\" = \"medium\",\n                                 \"strong democrat\" = \"high\"))\n\n# Check it out\n# Note that the new category labels are still in a meaningful,\n# not necessarily alphabetical, order!\nelections |&gt; \n  count(results_20)\n\n         results_20    n\n1 strong republican 2494\n2        close race  157\n3   strong democrat  458\n\n\nExample 4: Re-order Levels using fct_relevel\n\nFinally, let’s explore how the Republican vote varied from county to county within each state:\n\n# Note that we're just piping the data into ggplot instead of writing\n# it as the first argument\nelections |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x = repub_pct_20, fill = state_abbr)) + \n    geom_density(alpha = 0.5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is too many density plots to put on top of one another. Let’s spread these out while keeping them in the same frame, hence easier to compare, using a joy plot or ridge plot:\n\nlibrary(ggridges)\nelections |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x = repub_pct_20, y = state_abbr, fill = historical)) + \n    geom_density_ridges() + \n    scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"blue\", \"purple\", \"red\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOK, but this is alphabetical. Suppose we want to reorder the states according to their typical Republican support. Recall that we did something similar in Example 2, using fct_relevel() to specify a meaningful order for the dem_support_20 categories:\nfct_relevel(dem_support_20, c(\"low\", \"medium\", \"high\"))\nWe could use fct_relevel() to reorder the states here, but what would be the drawbacks?\nWe would have to have to do it all maniually and enter in 50 abbreviations\nExample 5: Re-order levels Based on Another Variable using fct_reorder\n\nWhen a meaningful order for the categories of a factor variable can be defined by another variable in our dataset, we can use fct_reorder(). In our joy plot, let’s reorder the states according to their median Republican support:\n\n# Since we might want states to be alphabetical in other parts of our analysis,\n# we'll pipe the data into the ggplot without storing it:\nelections |&gt; \n  mutate(state_abbr = fct_reorder(state_abbr, repub_pct_20, .fun = \"median\")) |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x = repub_pct_20, y = state_abbr, fill = historical)) + \n    geom_density_ridges() + \n    scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"blue\", \"purple\", \"red\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# How did the code change?\n#we added an argument to fct_reorder of \".desc=TRUE\"\n# And the corresponding output?\n#...is now ordered by median repub percent, but descending (still starting from the bottom, though)\nelections |&gt; \n  mutate(state_abbr = fct_reorder(state_abbr, repub_pct_20, .fun = \"median\", .desc = TRUE)) |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x = repub_pct_20, y = state_abbr, fill = historical)) + \n    geom_density_ridges() + \n    scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"blue\", \"purple\", \"red\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSummary\nThe forcats package, part of the tidyverse, includes handy functions for working with categorical variables (for + cats):\n\nHere are just some, few of which we explored above:\n\nfunctions for changing the order of factor levels\n\n\nfct_relevel() = manually reorder levels\n\nfct_reorder() = reorder levels according to values of another variable\n\n\nfct_infreq() = order levels from highest to lowest frequency\n\nfct_rev() = reverse the current order\n\n\nfunctions for changing the labels or values of factor levels\n\n\nfct_recode() = manually change levels\n\nfct_lump() = group together least common levels",

    "text": "17.2 Strings\nIn the previous class, we started discussing some considerations in working with special types of “categorical” variables: characters and factors which are:\n\nConverting characters to factors (and factors to meaningful factors)–last time\nWhen categorical information is stored as a character variable, the categories of interest might not be labeled or ordered in a meaningful way. We can fix that!\nStrings–today!\nWhen working with character strings, we might want to detect, replace, or extract certain patterns. For example, recall our data on courses:\n\n\n\n    sessionID dept level    sem enroll     iid\n1 session1784    M   100 FA1991     22 inst265\n2 session1785    k   100 FA1991     52 inst458\n3 session1791    J   100 FA1993     22 inst223\n4 session1792    J   300 FA1993     20 inst235\n5 session1794    J   200 FA1993     22 inst234\n6 session1795    J   200 SP1994     26 inst230\n\n\n'data.frame':   1718 obs. of  6 variables:\n $ sessionID: chr  \"session1784\" \"session1785\" \"session1791\" \"session1792\" ...\n $ dept     : chr  \"M\" \"k\" \"J\" \"J\" ...\n $ level    : int  100 100 100 300 200 200 200 100 300 100 ...\n $ sem      : chr  \"FA1991\" \"FA1991\" \"FA1993\" \"FA1993\" ...\n $ enroll   : int  22 52 22 20 22 26 25 38 16 43 ...\n $ iid      : chr  \"inst265\" \"inst458\" \"inst223\" \"inst235\" ...\n\n\nFocusing on just the sem character variable, we might want to…\n\nchange FA to fall_ and SP to spring_\n\nkeep only courses taught in fall\nsplit the variable into 2 new variables: semester (FA or SP) and year\n\n\n\nMuch more!–maybe in your projects or COMP/STAT 212\nThere are a lot of ways to process character variables. For example, we might have a variable that records the text for a sample of news articles. We might want to analyze things like the articles’ sentiments, word counts, typical word lengths, most common words, etc.\n\nEssential Functions\nThe stringr package within tidyverse contains lots of functions to help process strings. We’ll focus on the most common. Letting x be a string variable…\n\n\nfunction\narguments\nreturns\n\n\n\nstr_replace()\nx, pattern, replacement\na modified string\n\n\nstr_replace_all()\nx, pattern, replacement\na modified string\n\n\nstr_to_lower()\nx\na modified string\n\n\nstr_sub()\nx, start, end\na modified string\n\n\nstr_length()\nx\na number\n\n\nstr_detect()\nx, pattern\nTRUE/FALSE\n\n\nExample 1\nConsider the following data with string variables :\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\nclasses &lt;- data.frame(\n  sem        = c(\"SP2023\", \"FA2023\", \"SP2024\"),\n  area       = c(\"History\", \"Math\", \"Anthro\"),\n  enroll     = c(\"30 - people\", \"20 - people\", \"25 - people\"),\n  instructor = c(\"Ernesto Capello\", \"Lori Ziegelmeier\", \"Arjun Guneratne\")\n)\n\nclasses\n\n     sem    area      enroll       instructor\n1 SP2023 History 30 - people  Ernesto Capello\n2 FA2023    Math 20 - people Lori Ziegelmeier\n3 SP2024  Anthro 25 - people  Arjun Guneratne\n\n\nUsing only your intuition, use our str_ functions to complete the following. NOTE: You might be able to use other wrangling verbs in some cases, but focus on the new functions here.\n\n# Define a new variable \"num\" that adds up the number of characters in the area label\nclasses|&gt;\n  mutate(num=str_length(area))\n\n     sem    area      enroll       instructor num\n1 SP2023 History 30 - people  Ernesto Capello   7\n2 FA2023    Math 20 - people Lori Ziegelmeier   4\n3 SP2024  Anthro 25 - people  Arjun Guneratne   6\n\n\n\n# Change the areas to \"history\", \"math\", \"anthro\" instead of \"History\", \"Math\", \"Anthro\"\nclasses|&gt;\n  mutate(area=str_to_lower(area))\n\n     sem    area      enroll       instructor\n1 SP2023 history 30 - people  Ernesto Capello\n2 FA2023    math 20 - people Lori Ziegelmeier\n3 SP2024  anthro 25 - people  Arjun Guneratne\n\n\n\n# Create a variable that id's which courses were taught in spring\nclasses|&gt;\n  mutate(spring=str_detect(sem,\"SP\"))\n\n     sem    area      enroll       instructor spring\n1 SP2023 History 30 - people  Ernesto Capello   TRUE\n2 FA2023    Math 20 - people Lori Ziegelmeier  FALSE\n3 SP2024  Anthro 25 - people  Arjun Guneratne   TRUE\n\n\n\n# Change the semester labels to \"fall2023\", \"spring2024\", \"spring2023\"\nclasses|&gt;\n  mutate(sem=str_replace(sem,\"SP\",\"spring\")) |&gt;\n  mutate(sem=str_replace(sem,\"FA\",\"fall\"))\n\n         sem    area      enroll       instructor\n1 spring2023 History 30 - people  Ernesto Capello\n2   fall2023    Math 20 - people Lori Ziegelmeier\n3 spring2024  Anthro 25 - people  Arjun Guneratne\n\n\n\n# In the enroll variable, change all e's to 3's (just because?)\nclasses|&gt;\n  mutate(enroll=str_replace_all(enroll,\"e\",\"3\"))\n\n     sem    area      enroll       instructor\n1 SP2023 History 30 - p3opl3  Ernesto Capello\n2 FA2023    Math 20 - p3opl3 Lori Ziegelmeier\n3 SP2024  Anthro 25 - p3opl3  Arjun Guneratne\n\n\n\n# Use sem to create 2 new variables, one with only the semester (SP/FA) and 1 with the year\nclasses|&gt;\n  mutate(season=str_sub(sem,1,2)) |&gt;\n  mutate(year=str_sub(sem,3, 7))\n\n     sem    area      enroll       instructor season year\n1 SP2023 History 30 - people  Ernesto Capello     SP 2023\n2 FA2023    Math 20 - people Lori Ziegelmeier     FA 2023\n3 SP2024  Anthro 25 - people  Arjun Guneratne     SP 2024\n\n\nSummary\nHere’s what we learned about each function:\n\nstr_replace(x, pattern, replacement) finds the first part of x that matches the pattern and replaces it with replacement\nstr_replace_all(x, pattern, replacement) finds all instances in x that matches the pattern and replaces it with replacement\nstr_to_lower(x) converts all upper case letters in x to lower case\nstr_sub(x, start, end) only keeps a subset of characters in x, from start (a number indexing the first letter to keep) to end (a number indexing the last letter to keep)\nstr_length(x) records the number of characters in x\nstr_detect(x, pattern) is TRUE if x contains the given pattern and FALSE otherwise\n\n17.2.1 Example 2\nSuppose we only want the spring courses:\n\n# How can we do this after mutating?\nclasses |&gt; \n  mutate(spring = str_detect(sem, \"SP\")) |&gt;\n  filter(spring==TRUE)\n\n     sem    area      enroll      instructor spring\n1 SP2023 History 30 - people Ernesto Capello   TRUE\n2 SP2024  Anthro 25 - people Arjun Guneratne   TRUE\n\n\n\n# We don't have to mutate first!\nclasses |&gt; \n  filter(str_detect(sem, \"SP\"))\n\n     sem    area      enroll      instructor\n1 SP2023 History 30 - people Ernesto Capello\n2 SP2024  Anthro 25 - people Arjun Guneratne\n\n\n\n# Yet another way\nclasses |&gt; \n  filter(!str_detect(sem, \"FA\"))\n\n     sem    area      enroll      instructor\n1 SP2023 History 30 - people Ernesto Capello\n2 SP2024  Anthro 25 - people Arjun Guneratne\n\n\n\n17.2.2 Example 3\nSuppose we wanted to get separate columns for the first and last names of each course instructor in classes. Try doing this using str_sub(). But don’t try too long! Explain what trouble you ran into.\nBefore really trying, I can already tell that I will run into rouble because the first names are different lengths, meaning there is reliable first character to start on using str_sub()\n\n17.2.3 Example 4\nIn general, when we want to split a column into 2+ new columns, we can often use separate():\n\nclasses |&gt; \n  separate(instructor, c(\"first\", \"last\"), sep = \" \")\n\n     sem    area      enroll   first        last\n1 SP2023 History 30 - people Ernesto     Capello\n2 FA2023    Math 20 - people    Lori Ziegelmeier\n3 SP2024  Anthro 25 - people   Arjun   Guneratne\n\n\n\n# Sometimes the function can \"intuit\" how we want to separate the variable\nclasses |&gt; \n  separate(instructor, c(\"first\", \"last\"))\n\n     sem    area      enroll   first        last\n1 SP2023 History 30 - people Ernesto     Capello\n2 FA2023    Math 20 - people    Lori Ziegelmeier\n3 SP2024  Anthro 25 - people   Arjun   Guneratne\n\n\n\nSeparate enroll into 2 separate columns: students and people. (These columns don’t make sense this is just practice).\n\n\nclasses |&gt;\n  separate(enroll, c(\"num\", \"species\"), sep = \" - \")\n\n     sem    area num species       instructor\n1 SP2023 History  30  people  Ernesto Capello\n2 FA2023    Math  20  people Lori Ziegelmeier\n3 SP2024  Anthro  25  people  Arjun Guneratne\n\n\n\nWe separated sem into semester and year above using str_sub(). Why would this be hard using separate()?\n\nThere is nothing between the semester and year scriptors\n\nWhen we want to split a column into 2+ new columns (or do other types of string processing), but there’s no consistent pattern by which to do this, we can use regular expressions (an optional topic):\n\n\n# (?&lt;=[SP|FA]): any character *before* the split point is a \"SP\" or \"FA\"\n# (?=2): the first character *after* the split point is a 2\nclasses |&gt; \n  separate(sem, \n          c(\"semester\", \"year\"),\n          \"(?&lt;=[SP|FA])(?=2)\")\n\n  semester year    area      enroll       instructor\n1       SP 2023 History 30 - people  Ernesto Capello\n2       FA 2023    Math 20 - people Lori Ziegelmeier\n3       SP 2024  Anthro 25 - people  Arjun Guneratne\n\n\n\n# More general:\n# (?&lt;=[a-zA-Z]): any character *before* the split point is a lower or upper case letter\n# (?=[0-9]): the first character *after* the split point is number\nclasses |&gt; \n  separate(sem, \n          c(\"semester\", \"year\"),\n          \"(?&lt;=[A-Z])(?=[0-9])\")\n\n  semester year    area      enroll       instructor\n1       SP 2023 History 30 - people  Ernesto Capello\n2       FA 2023    Math 20 - people Lori Ziegelmeier\n3       SP 2024  Anthro 25 - people  Arjun Guneratne",

HINT: You’ll need as.numeric()\n\n\n\nSplit the course number into 3 separate variables: dept, number, and section. HINT: You can use separate() to split a variable into 3, not just 2 new variables.\n\nStore this as courses_clean so that you can use it later.\n\ncourses_clean &lt;- courses |&gt;\n  separate(avail_max,c(\"avail\",\"max\"),sep=\" / \") |&gt;\n  mutate(enroll=as.numeric(max)-as.numeric(avail)) |&gt;\n  separate(number,c(\"dept\",\"number\",\"section\"))\n\nExercise 3: Courses by department\nUsing courses_clean…\n\n# Identify the 6 departments that offered the most sections\ncourses_clean |&gt;\n  group_by(dept) |&gt;\n  summarize(sec=n()) |&gt;\n  arrange(desc(sec)) |&gt;\n  head()\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 2\n  dept    sec\n  &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt;\n1 SPAN     45\n2 BIOL     44\n3 ENVI     38\n4 PSYC     37\n5 CHEM     33\n6 COMP     31\n\n# Identify the 6 departments with the longest average course titles\ncourses_clean |&gt;\n  mutate(namelen=str_length(name)) |&gt;\n  group_by(dept) |&gt;\n  summarize(avg=mean(namelen)) |&gt;\n  arrange(desc(avg)) |&gt;\n  head()\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 2\n  dept    avg\n  &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 WGSS   46.3\n2 INTL   41.4\n3 EDUC   39.4\n4 MCST   39.4\n5 POLI   37.4\n6 AMST   37.3\n\n\nExercise 4: STAT courses\nPart a\nGet a subset of courses_clean that only includes courses taught by Alicia Johnson.\n\ncourses_clean |&gt;\n  filter(instructor==\"Alicia Johnson\")\n\n  dept number section   crn                         name  days            time\n1 STAT    253      01 10806 Statistical Machine Learning  T R  9:40 - 11:10 am\n2 STAT    253      02 10807 Statistical Machine Learning  T R   1:20 - 2:50 pm\n3 STAT    253      03 10808 Statistical Machine Learning  T R   3:00 - 4:30 pm\n        room     instructor avail max enroll\n1 THEATR 206 Alicia Johnson    -3  20     23\n2 THEATR 206 Alicia Johnson    -3  20     23\n3 THEATR 206 Alicia Johnson     2  20     18\n\n\nPart b\nCreate a new dataset from courses_clean, named stat, that only includes STAT sections. In this dataset:\n\n\nIn the course names:\n\nRemove “Introduction to” from any name.\nShorten “Statistical” to “Stat” where relevant.\n\n\nDefine a variable that records the start_time for the course.\nKeep only the number, name, start_time, enroll columns.\nThe result should have 19 rows and 4 columns.\nExercise 5: More cleaning\nIn the next exercises, we’ll dig into enrollments. Let’s get the data ready for that analysis here. Make the following changes to the courses_clean data. Because they have different enrollment structures, and we don’t want to compare apples and oranges, remove the following:\n\nall sections in PE and INTD (interdisciplinary studies courses)\nall music ensembles and dance practicums, i.e. all MUSI and THDA classes with numbers less than 100. HINT: !(dept == \"MUSI\" & as.numeric(number) &lt; 100)\nall lab sections. Be careful which variable you use here. For example, you don’t want to search by “Lab” and accidentally eliminate courses with words such as “Labor”.\n\nSave the results as enrollments (don’t overwrite courses_clean).\nExercise 6: Enrollment & departments\nExplore enrollments by department. You decide what research questions to focus on. Use both visual and numerical summaries.\nExercise 7: Enrollment & faculty\nLet’s now explore enrollments by instructor. In doing so, we have to be cautious of cross-listed courses that are listed under multiple different departments. Uncomment the code lines in the chunk below for an example.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCommenting/Uncommenting Code\n\n\n\nTo comment/uncomment several lines of code at once, highlight them then click ctrl/cmd+shift+c.\n\n\n\n# enrollments |&gt;\n#   filter(dept %in% c(\"STAT\", \"COMP\"), number == 112, section == \"01\")\n\nNotice that these are the exact same section! In order to not double count an instructor’s enrollments, we can keep only the courses that have distinct() combinations of days, time, instructor values. Uncomment the code lines in the chunk below.\n\n# enrollments_2 &lt;- enrollments |&gt; \n#   distinct(days, time, instructor, .keep_all = TRUE)\n\n# NOTE: By default this keeps the first department alphabetically\n# That's fine because we won't use this to analyze department enrollments!\n# enrollments_2 |&gt; \n#   filter(instructor == \"Brianna Heggeseth\", name == \"Introduction to Data Science\")\n\nNow, explore enrollments by instructor. You decide what research questions to focus on. Use both visual and numerical summaries.\nCAVEAT: The above code doesn’t deal with co-taught courses that have more than one instructor. Thus instructors that co-taught are recorded as a pair, and their co-taught enrollments aren’t added to their total enrollments. This is tough to get around with how the data were scraped as the instructor names are smushed together, not separated by a comma!\nOptional extra practice\n\n# Make a bar plot showing the number of night courses by day of the week\n# Use courses_clean\n\nDig Deeper: regex\nExample 4 gave 1 small example of a regular expression.\nThese are handy when we want process a string variable, but there’s no consistent pattern by which to do this. You must think about the structure of the string and how you can use regular expressions to capture the patterns you want (and exclude the patterns you don’t want).\nFor example, how would you describe the pattern of a 10-digit phone number? Limit yourself to just a US phone number for now.\n\nThe first 3 digits are the area code.\nThe next 3 digits are the exchange code.\nThe last 4 digits are the subscriber number.\n\nThus, a regular expression for a US phone number could be:\n\n\n[:digit:]{3}-[:digit:]{3}-[:digit:]{4} which limits you to XXX-XXX-XXXX pattern or\n\n\\\\([:digit:]{3}\\\\) [:digit:]{3}-[:digit:]{4} which limits you to (XXX) XXX-XXXX pattern or\n\n[:digit:]{3}\\\\.[:digit:]{3}\\\\.[:digit:]{4} which limits you to XXX.XXX.XXXX pattern\n\nThe following would include the three patterns above in addition to the XXXXXXXXXX pattern (no dashes or periods): - [\\\\(]*[:digit:]{3}[-.\\\\)]*[:digit:]{3}[-.]*[:digit:]{4}\nIn order to write a regular expression, you first need to consider what patterns you want to include and exclude.\nWork through the following examples, and the tutorial after them to learn about the syntax.\nEXAMPLES\n\n# Define some strings to play around with\nexample &lt;- \"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.\"\n\n\nstr_replace(example, \"quick\", \"really quick\")\n\n[1] \"The really quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.\"\n\n\n\nstr_replace_all(example, \"(fox|dog)\", \"****\") # | reads as OR\n\n[1] \"The quick brown **** jumps over the lazy ****.\"\n\n\n\nstr_replace_all(example, \"(fox|dog).\", \"****\") # \".\" for any character\n\n[1] \"The quick brown ****jumps over the lazy ****\"\n\n\n\nstr_replace_all(example, \"(fox|dog)\\\\.$\", \"****\") # at end of sentence only, \"\\\\.\" only for a period\n\n[1] \"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy ****\"\n\n\n\nstr_replace_all(example, \"the\", \"a\") # case-sensitive only matches one\n\n[1] \"The quick brown fox jumps over a lazy dog.\"\n\n\n\nstr_replace_all(example, \"[Tt]he\", \"a\") # # will match either t or T; could also make \"a\" conditional on capitalization of t\n\n[1] \"a quick brown fox jumps over a lazy dog.\"\n\n\n\nstr_replace_all(example, \"[Tt]he\", \"a\") # first match only\n\n[1] \"a quick brown fox jumps over a lazy dog.\"\n\n\n\n# More examples\nexample2 &lt;- \"Two roads diverged in a yellow wood, / And sorry I could not travel both / And be one traveler, long I stood / And looked down one as far as I could\"\nexample3 &lt;- \"This is a test\"\n\n# Store the examples in 1 place\nexamples &lt;- c(example, example2, example3)\n\n\npat &lt;- \"[^aeiouAEIOU ]{3}\" # Regular expression for three straight consonants.

The topic of effective viz is too big and nuanced to boil down into a simple list. Here are some basics:\nProfessionalism\nOnce you’re ready to “share out” your viz, it should have…\n\nmeaningful axis labels\na figure caption (depending upon where the viz will appear)\nAccessibility\nOnce you’re ready to “share out” your viz, it should…\n\nhave “alt text”, a written description of the viz that can be read out by a screen reader (video)\nuse a color palette that is distinguishable across common forms of color blindness\nDesign Details\nIn designing your viz, think about comparison. Good viz make it easy for people to perceive things that are similar and things that are different.\nEthics\nMichael Correll of Tableau Research (pdf) wrote “Data visualizations have a potentially enormous influence on how data are used to make decisions across all areas of human endeavor.” Thus ethics are critical from the data we use, to the plots we build, to the way in which we communicate this work. This is a very broad topic, and we’ll focus here on data visualization alone. Relatedly, and at a minimum:\n\nData viz should not mislead, i.e. “wrong” viz are unethical.**\nYet ethics in data viz goes much deeper. Correll describes three related principles to strive for:\n\nVisibility\nMake the invisible visible. Visualize hidden labor, hidden uncertainty, hidden impacts. Credit your sources, data and otherwise.\nPrivacy\nCollect data with empathy. Encourage small Data, anthropomorphize data, obfuscate data to protect privacy.\nPower\nChallenge structures of power. Support data due process, act as data advocates, pressure unethical analytical behavior.\n\n\nTo this list, Data Feminism authors Catherine D’Ignazio and Lauren F. Klein added:\n\nEmotion & Embodiment\nValue multiple forms of knowledge, including the knowledge that comes from people as living, feeling bodies in the world.\nPluralism\nThe most complete knowledge comes from synthesizing multiple perspectives\nContext\nData are not neutral or objective",

    "text": "18.4 Exercises\nExercise 1: Professionalism\nLet’s examine weather in 3 Australian locations.\n\n# Load tidyverse package for plotting and wrangling\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n# Import the data\nweather &lt;- read.csv(\"https://mac-stat.github.io/data/weather_3_locations.csv\") |&gt; \n  mutate(date = as.Date(date))\n\nThe following plot is fine for things like homework or just playing around. But we’ll make it more “professional” looking below.\n\nggplot(weather, aes(y = temp3pm, x = temp9am, color = location)) + \n  geom_point()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPart a\nReplace A, B, C, and D in the code below to:\n\nAdd a short, but descriptive title. Under 10 words.\nChange the x- and y-axis labels, currently just the names of the variables in the dataset. These should be short and include units.\nChange the legend title to “Location” (just for practice, not because it’s better than “location”).\n\n\nggplot(weather, aes(y = temp3pm, x = temp9am, color = location)) + \n  geom_point() + \n  labs(x = \"Temperature at 9 AM (Degrees Celsius)\", y = \"Temperature at 3 PM (Degrees Celsius)\", title = \"Daily Temperature Shifts in Australia\", color = \"Location\")  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPart b\nWhen we’re including our plot in an article, paper, book, or other similar outlet, we should (and are expected to) provide a more descriptive figure caption. Typically, this is instead of a title and is more descriptive of what exactly is being plotted.\n\nAdd a figure caption in the top of the chunk.\nInclude your x-axis, y-axis, and legend labels from Part a.\nRender your Rmd and check out how the figure caption appears.\n\n\n\n\n\n???\n\n\n\n\nggplot(weather, aes(y = temp3pm, x = temp9am, color = location)) + \n  geom_point() + \n  labs(x = \"Temperature at 9 AM (Degrees Celsius)\", y = \"Temperature at 3 PM (Degrees Celsius)\", color = \"Location\")  \n\n\n\nFIGURE 1. 9 AM versus 3 PM temperatures in a given day in the Australian cities of Hobart, Uluru, and Wollongong\n\n\n\n\nExercise 2: Accessibility\nLet’s now make a graphic more accessible.\n\nggplot(weather, aes(x = temp3pm, fill = location)) + \n  geom_density(alpha = 0.5) + \n  labs(x = \"3pm temperature (Celsius)\")  \n\n\n\nDensity plots of 3pm temperatures in 3 Australian locations.\n\n\n\nPart a\nLet’s add some alt text that can be picked up by screen readers. This is a great resource on writing alt text for data viz. In short, whereas figure captions are quick descriptions which assume that the viz is accessible, alt text is a longer description which assumes the viz is not accessible. Alt text should concisely articulate:\n\nWhat your visualization is (e.g. a density plot of 3pm temperatures in Hobart, Uluru, and Wollongong, Australia).\nA 1-sentence description of the most important takeaway.\nA link to your data source if it’s not already in the caption.\n\nAdd appropriate alt text at the top of the chunk, in fig-alt. Then render your qmd, and hover over the image in your rendered html file to check out the alt text.\n\nggplot(weather, aes(x = temp3pm, fill = location)) + \n  geom_density(alpha = 0.5) + \n  labs(x = \"3pm temperature (Celsius)\")  \n\n\n\nDensity plots of 3pm temperatures in 3 Australian locations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDensity plots of 3pm temperatures in 3 Australian locations.\n\n\n\n\nPart b\nColor is another important accessibility consideration. Let’s check out the color accessibility of our density plot.\n\nRun the ggplot() code from Part a in your console. The viz will pop up in the Plots tab.\nIn the Plots tab, click “Export” then “Save as image”. Save the image somewhere.\nNavigate to https://www.color-blindness.com/coblis-color-blindness-simulator/\n\nAbove the image of crayons (I think it’s crayons?), click “Choose file” and choose the plot file you just saved.\nClick the various simulator buttons (eg: Red-Weak/Protanomaly) to check out how the colors in this plot might appear to others.\nSummarize what you learn. What impact might our color choices have on one’s ability to interpret the viz? For those with Protanopia, our viz is somewhat hard to read, for those with Tritanomaly, it is very hard to read, and for those with Tritanopia and Monochromacy, it is near-illegible. We cannot rely and singular value color distinctions: it may be very useful to incorporate brightness into our visualizations\nPart c\nWe can change our color schemes! There are many color-blind friendly palettes in R. In the future, we’ll set a default, more color-blind friendly color theme at the top of our Rmds. We can also do this individually for any plot that uses color. Run the chunks below to explore various options.\n\nggplot(weather, aes(x = temp3pm, fill = location)) + \n  geom_density(alpha = 0.5) + \n  labs(x = \"3pm temperature (Celsius)\") + \n  scale_fill_viridis_d()    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# In the color scale line:\n# Change \"fill\" to \"color\" since we use color in the aes()\n# Change \"d\" (discrete) to \"c\" (continuous) since maxtemp is on a continuous scale\nggplot(weather, aes(y = temp3pm, x = temp9am, color = maxtemp)) + \n  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) + \n  labs(x = \"3pm temperature (Celsius)\") + \n  scale_color_viridis_c()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 3: Ethics\nLet’s scratch the surface of ethics in data viz. Central to this discussion is the consideration of impact.\nPart a\nAt a minimum, our data viz should not mislead. Reconsider the climate change example from above. Why is this plot unethical and what impact might it have on policy, public opinion, etc?\nBecause the excessively wide scale not only minimizes the impact of climate change, but also makes any data nearly illegible\n\nPart b\nAgain, data viz ethical considerations go beyond whether or not a plot is misleading. As described in the warm-up, we need to consider: visibility, privacy, power, emotion & embodiment, pluralism, & context. Depending upon the audience and goals of a data viz, addressing these points might require more nuance. Mainly, the viz tools we’ve learned are a great base or foundation, but aren’t the only approaches to data viz. \nPick one or more of the following examples of data viz to discuss with your group. How do the approaches taken: Decolonizing Data - emphasize one or more of: visibility, privacy, power, emotion, embodiment, pluralism, and/or context? It depends how you look at it: if we are talking shown visualizations themselves, they emphasize visibility (many different categorical variables, and most common data is acknowledging people of origin/where you come from) and Emotion & Embodiment (They often record highly personal information about the experiences and history of either the creator or displayer of the visualization). On the other hand, the article on whole and the concept of “Decolonizing Data” is more in line with Power (Challenging the eurocentric narrative developed around data and advocating for historical and contemporary indigenous viz) and Pluralism (Acknowledging several different indigenous perspectives and comparing them with dominant styles of viz) - improve upon what we might be able to convey with a simpler bar chart, scatterplot, etc? It shows a lot of different ways to represent variables, and also encourages us to draw on different traditional methodologies of encoding knowledge and data in how we construct our viz\n\nExample: W.E.B. Du Bois (1868–1963)\nDu Bois (“Doo Boys”) was a “sociologist, socialist, historian, civil rights activist, Pan-Africanist, author, writer, and editor”1. He was also a pioneer in elevating emotion and embodiment in data visualization. For the Paris World Fair of 1900, Du Bois and his team of students from Atlanta University presented 60 data visualizations of the Black experience in America, less than 50 years after the abolishment of slavery. Du Bois noted: “I wanted to set down its aim and method in some outstanding way which would bring my work to notice by the thinking world.” That is, he wanted to increase the impact of his work by partnering technical visualizations with design that better connects to lived experiences. NOTE: This work uses language common to that time period and addresses the topic of slavery. Check out:\n\nA complete set of the data visualizations provided by Anthony Starks (@ajstarks).\nAn article by Allen Hillery (@AlDatavizguy).\n\n\nExample: One person’s experience with long COVID\nNYT article\n\nExample: Decolonizing data viz\nblog post\n\nExample: Visualizing climate change through art\nFutures North with Prof John Kim & Mac students (by Prof Kim, Mac research students)\n\nExample: Personal data collection\nDear Data\n\nPart c\nFor a deeper treatment of similar topics, and more examples, read Data Feminism.\n\nExercise 4: Critique\nPractice critiquing some more complicated data viz listed at Modern Data Science with R, Exercise 2.5.\nThink about the following questions: I looked at the 2013 budget viz - What story does the data graphic tell? What is the main message that you take away from it? While there were moderate increases in sections like Medicare and Medicaid, and SSI, these were mainly mandatory, and the biggest changes in discrentionary spending were cuts to military spending on Procurement, Operation and Maintainence, R&D, and Personnel, to meet the budget cap. - Can the data graphic be described in terms of the Grammar of Graphics (frame, glyphs, aesthetics, facet, scale, guide)? If so, please describe. - Critique and/or praise the visualization choices made by the designer. Do they work? Are they misleading? Thought-provoking? Are there things that you would have done differently?\n\nExercise 5: Design Details\nThis final exercise is just “food for thought”. It’s more of a discussion than an exercise, and gets into some of the finer design details and data viz theory. Go as deep or not deep as you’d like here.\nIn refining the details of our data viz, Visualize This and Storytelling with Data provide some of their guiding principles. But again, every context is different.\n\nPut yourself in a reader’s shoes. What parts of the data need explanation?\nShine a light on your data. Try to remove any “chart junk” that distracts from the data.\nVary color and style to emphasize the viz elements that are most important to the story you’re telling.\nIt is easier to judge length than it is to judge area or angles.\nBe thoughtful about how your categories are ordered for categorical data.\n\nGetting into even more of the nitty gritty, we need to be mindful of what geometric elements and aesthetics we use. The following elements/aesthetics are listed in roughly descending order of human ability to perceive and compare nearby objects:2\n\nPosition\nLength\nAngle\nDirection\nShape (but only a very few different shapes)\nArea\nVolume\nShade\nColor. (Color is the most difficult, because it is a 3-dimensional quantity.)\n\nFinally, here are some facts to keep in mind about visual perception from Now You See It.\nPart a: Selectivity\nVisual perception is selective, and our attention is often drawn to contrasts from the norm.\nImplication: We should design visualizations so that the features we want to highlight stand out in contrast from those that are not worth the audience’s attention.\nExample: What stands out in this example image? This is originally from C. Ware, Information Visualization: Perception for Design, 2004? Source: S. Few, Now You See It, 2009, p. 33.\n\nPart b: Familiarity\nOur eyes are drawn to familiar patterns. We observe what we know and expect.\nImplication: Visualizations work best when they display information as patterns that familiar and easy to spot.\nExample: Do you notice anything embedded in this rose image from coolbubble.com? Source: S. Few, Now You See It, 2009, p. 34.\n\nPart c: Revisit\nRevisit Part b. Do you notice anything in the shadows?
